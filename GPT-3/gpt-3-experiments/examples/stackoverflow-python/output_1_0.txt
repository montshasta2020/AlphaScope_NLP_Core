How to password protect an android app? (python 3.8.0) ________________________________ From: postgres-python-bounce@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx [mailto:postgres-python-bounce@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx] On Behalf Of van.scoerij Sent: 2 October 2018 02:43 To: postgres-python@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Subject: Re: [postgres-python] Sorting text files with numeric No, what I really mean is that I want to step through each line in each file separately and work with line-at-a-time data. Then sort a number of lines (just 4 per line) that contain my numeric data. The ordering is important, and so far, the sorting is, too. I am new to Python, but not to unix/post-ggsql programming, and I think I need to write this it in C. I just don't know how the Step 7 in the OP works and whether I can make it work or not. The RecordReader and Buffered I think are not as easy to use as in other statistical packages. I started to read the C code of numpy for an answer, but following through that stuff is simply too hard for me. So, if someone could tell me how Step 7 in the OP really works or point me to a better solution for my problem, I would really appreciate it. Thanks for looking into my problem. vScoerij ________________________________ Developer, NoSQL, Performance ________________________________ Van Scoer
