The difference between (finite) associativity and (finite) commutativity is that in the commutative case, we can permute the operands in any way we like, whereas in the associative case, we have to apply the operation in a left-to-right fashion.

This difference can be seen more clearly by considering the case of subtraction, where we have:

x @ (-y) = x + (-y) + 7
x @ y = x - y + 7

This is an associative operation, but not a commutative one. We can rearrange the operands in any way we like, and still obtain the same result:

x @ (-y) = x + (-y) + 7
y @ (-x) = y + (-x) + 7

However, if we have subtraction with only two operands, we can only rearrange the operands in a left-to-right fashion:

x @ y = x - y + 7

The general definition of an associative operation is an operation that can be applied in any order to the operands. The general definition of a commutative operation is an operation that can be applied in any order to the operands, and gives the same result.

A ring with two binary operations is said to be associative if and only if it is both a left and a right ring.

This approach has the disadvantage of having the array always grow from left to right. To have it grow from right to left, we have to store the sign and the array at opposite ends of the array, like so:

5 @ -1 = -7
0 @ -3 = -5
-1 @ -4 = -6
1 @ -5 = -4
0 @ -7 = -3
-1 @ -8 = -2
-2 @ -9 = -1

We can have it grow from the top down or bottom up. We will illustrate the top-down approach. For the bottom-up approach, reverse the array.

0 @ 0 = 0
-1 @ 1 = -1
-2 @ 2 = -3
-3 @ 3 = -6
-4 @ 4 = -10
-5 @ 5 = -15
-6 @ 6 = -22
-7 @ 7 = -35
-8 @ 8 = -56
-9 @ 9 = -89

We can also have it grow from the left or right. We will illustrate the left-to-right approach. For the right-to-left approach, reverse the array.

-1 @ 0 = -1
0 @ -1 = 0
-2 @ -1 = 2
-3 @ -2 = 6
-4 @ -3 = 12
-5 @ -4 = 20
-6 @ -5 = 35
-7 @ -6 = 56

For each of these three directions, we can have it grow from the top down, bottom up, or left to right.

For the top-down approach, we will start the array at 0.

-1 @ 0 = -1
0 @ -1 = 0
-2 @ -1 = 2
-3 @ -2 = 6
-4 @ -3 = 12
-5 @ -4 = 20

For the bottom-up approach, we will start the array at -9.

0 @ -9 = 0
-1 @ -8 = -1
-2 @ -7 = -3
-3 @ -6 = -6
-4 @ -5 = -12
-5 @ -4 = -20

For the left-to-right approach, we will start

A product (denoted by juxtaposition) of two elements is the first multiplied by the second. For example, 2 * 3 = 6.

The notation for exponentiation is a caret (^) followed by the base. For example, 3^2 = 9.

Negation is denoted by the negation symbol "~" or "¬" and is applied to an element by placing the negation symbol in front of the element. For example, ~1 = -1 and ¬2 = -2.

A fraction is denoted by the fraction bar " |" and is applied to an element by placing the fraction bar in front of the element. For example, 1 | 2 = 1/2.

An ordered pair is denoted by a left bracket "[" and a right bracket "]". The elements are separated by a comma. For example, [3, 2] = (3, 2).

A sequence is denoted by a left square bracket "[" and a right square bracket "]". The elements are separated by a comma. For example, [3, 2, 1] = (3, 2, 1).

A set is denoted by a left curly bracket "{", an element, a comma, and a right curly bracket "}". For example, {3, 2} = {3, 2}.

A string is denoted by a left angle bracket "<", an element, a right angle bracket ">", and a string. For example, "<1> = <1>" = <1>.

The main use of the brackets is to denote the set of all elements satisfying a certain condition.

A binary relation is denoted by a left arrow "<", an element, a right arrow ">", and an element. For example, "<2, 3>" = (2, 3).

The main use of the arrow is to denote the image of a function.

The binary relation "<" is a strict order, denoted by a set of brackets, a set of arrows, or a set of both.

A subset of a set is denoted by a left set bracket "[" and a right set bracket "]". For example, {2, 3} is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The set of all subsets of a set is denoted by a

All of these examples result in a runtime error, but are correct in their own right. The first example results in a value of 3 being passed to a function expecting a value of 4. The second example results in a value of 10 being passed to a function expecting a value of 1. The third example results in a value of 7 being passed to a function expecting a value of 2. The fourth example results in a value of 3 being passed to a function expecting a value of 1. The fifth example results in a value of 5 being passed to a function expecting a value of 1.

Currying can be implemented in functional languages like Scheme, Standard ML, OCaml, Haskell, or Scala, and in object-oriented languages like C++ or Java.

The following Scheme implementation of a factorial function demonstrates currying:

This implementation is not tail recursive, because the recursive call to the function codice_1 is made before the value is returned from the function.

A more idiomatic version of the above function is

Here, the parameter codice_2 is partially applied by naming only the first two parameters (codice_3 and codice_4), and the result is bound to the variable codice_5. The body of the function is then called with the arguments codice_3 and codice_4. This is a more typical implementation of a functional language, and it does not suffer from the tail call recursion problem.

The Haskell implementation of the factorial function

is similar to the Scheme implementation above.

Currying is supported by the Scala programming language, which supports the following syntax:

Currying is implemented in C++ by function objects, and currying by class template partial specialization. For example, the following C++ code implements the curry() function from the Haskell example above:

This can be used as follows:

Currying is implemented in Java by anonymous classes. For example, the following Java code implements the curry() function from the Haskell example above:

This can be used as follows:

Currying is implemented in JavaScript by the use of Function.prototype.bind. For example, the following JavaScript code implements the curry() function from the Haskell example above:

This can be used as follows:

Currying is implemented in the Java programming language by anonymous classes. For example, the following Java code implements the curry() function from the

These examples suggest that the notation @ can be read as “times”, so we can think of @ as multiplication in the sense of repeated addition. This makes it consistent with the other operator, -, which we can read as “minus”. (If we are willing to stretch a point, we could say that multiplication in this sense is a sort of subtraction.)

The word “tensor” is not really part of the definition of tensor products. It is merely a suggestive name for an object that generalizes some of the familiar properties of matrices. The following properties are special cases of the general tensor product rule.

For all "A", "B", "C", "D" in "C", the following equalities hold:

and hence the matrix product of "A" and "B" is defined to be the tensor product of "A" and "B".

The number of "n"-dimensional vectors that can be formed from "n" elements is given by the formula:

In particular, in the case of a vector space with a finite basis, the number of "n"-dimensional vectors that can be formed from "n" elements is the number of basis vectors.

The number of "n"-dimensional "tensor" products of the vector space "V" with itself is given by the formula:

In particular, in the case of a vector space with a finite basis, the number of "n"-dimensional tensor products of the vector space "V" with itself is the number of basis tensor products.

The number of "n"-dimensional "tensor" products of "V" with itself is given by the formula:

The dimension of the "n"-dimensional "tensor" product of "V" with itself is the sum of the dimensions of "V" and "V":

This formula shows that the dimension of the "n"-dimensional "tensor" product of "V" with itself is the sum of the dimensions of "V" and "V".

The "n"-dimensional "tensor" product of "V" with itself is a vector space over the field "F" of scalars "F" (i.e. the field of scalars "F" is the set of all scalars "s" in "F" and the vector space "V" is defined over the scalars "s

In contrast, the second term in the denominator (which we'll call "n") represents the number of positive factors that the number "x" has. In the case of 10, we have two positive factors: 1 and 10. The second term of the denominator is thus 2.

Now, we have a new problem. "a" is still positive, so we know it is greater than 1. "b" is also positive, and is therefore greater than 0. The question is, is "b" greater than "n"?

If "b" is greater than "n", then the numerator in our fraction will be greater than 1. In this case, the fraction is greater than 1, and therefore greater than 1/2.

On the other hand, if "b" is less than "n", then the numerator in our fraction will be less than 1. In this case, the fraction is less than 1/2, and therefore less than 1.

If we look at the values for which the numerator in our fraction is greater than 1, we see that they are all greater than 1. Similarly, if we look at the values for which the numerator is less than 1, we see that they are all less than 1. This means that if the numerator is greater than 1, then the fraction is greater than 1/2, and if the numerator is less than 1, then the fraction is less than 1/2.

In short, the fraction is always greater than 1/2, and less than 1.

This example illustrates that we can't just look at the values of the fraction to see if it is greater than 1/2 or less than 1. Instead, we have to look at the values of the numerator and the denominator separately, and then use this information to see if the fraction is greater than 1/2 or less than 1.

This approach to finding the values of a rational number will work for all fractions, and will allow us to solve many problems involving rational numbers.

Now that we know how to find the values of rational numbers, let's see how we can use this information to solve some problems involving rational numbers.

We'll start with the following problem.
