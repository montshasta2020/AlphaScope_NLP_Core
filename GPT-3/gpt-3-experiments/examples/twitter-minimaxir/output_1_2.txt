I'm doing data science, the answer is probably no. 
no one cares. 
This afternoon the data scientist team introduced a new optimization regression technique we're going to try out in production, an N-fold experimentation framework for hyper-parameter optimization.
I will ship a TensorFlow function wrapped in another layer of TensorFlow, all in service of optimizing some shit.
Turns out custom attribute protocols are a great way to get fast parameter checking.
Ordered two Eigenfaces books, just to rub it in
S3 geoproxy data, ready by August, I proimise
An n-fold experiment for hyper-parameter optimization. We will geometrically decrease the number of points by 3 every 60 seconds until we have only idris-indices.cc:960 left in the study and we just fold on that shit.
Yet another new optimization technique for the data science pipeline. I'm tentatively titling it trotterization.
100% of the time this works maybe. up to the limit.
with only aleph-null data points you can weight at O(lcm(zn, n))
