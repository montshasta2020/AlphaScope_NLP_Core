**INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORâ€™S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING**

**MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.**

**PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.**

**MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.**

**MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.**

**PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?**

**MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.**

**PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!**

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

MACE: (to his JEDI) Seize him.
