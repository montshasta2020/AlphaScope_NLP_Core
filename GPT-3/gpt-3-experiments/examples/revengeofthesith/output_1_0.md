**INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING**

**MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.**

**PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.**

**MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.**

**MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.**

**PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?**

**MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.**

**PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!**

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

His sword flickers out to thirty feet.

MACE: (to his three JEDI) Attack!

The JEDI ignite their lightsabers.

PALPATINE moves to attack MACE, but YODA attacks first. PALPATINE parries the blow. The other JEDI attack PALPATINE simultaneously. The four lightsaber battle through the office, knocking chairs, stools, and artwork to the floor. PALPATINE is backed against the wall.

PALPATINE: Quite entertaining, Yoda, but this is getting us nowhere.

YODA: You are a liar and a Sith Lord.

PALPATINE: (beat) I know.

PALPATINE swings his cloak around at YODA, and YODA uses the Force to keep it from his face.

PALPATINE slaps YODA with the back of the cloak and sends him flying across the room. MACE continues to beset the RED ROBED MALE.

MACE: Enough of this!

MACE uses the Force to levitate PALPATINE with one hand, and he fight with the JEDI.

JEDI: I've got him.

The JEDI restrains PALPATINE in the air with the Force.

PALPATINE: I am the Senate!

YODA jumps up onto the Chancellor's desk.

YODA: Not yet.

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

The JEDI ignite their laser swords and are about to attack when PALPATINE suddenly stops, restrained, and looks down. He is surprised and looks toward the JEDI, puzzled by what he sees.

MACE: Now it's treason.

MACE looks down and sees OBI-WAN fine tune his aim.

MACE: Thank you, Master Kenobi.

PALPATINE: Too late, Master Jedi. Even now, my fleets are in motion.

As MACE looks to OBI-WAN for an answer, PALPATINE gets his lightsaber close enough to one of the MASTER JEDI by him and he finally cuts his head off. The rest of the JEDI fight PALPATINE as OBI-WAN walks behind his desk.

PALPATINE: Don't let this distract you.

MACE: Step away from the Chancellor, Anakin.

OBI-WAN inserts a disc in his computer and PALPATINE enters a command. The huge window behind the desk begins to open.

OBI-WAN: Destroy the window, Anakin.

MACE: Throw him out, quickly.

PALPATINE runs at MACE and the other JEDI.

PALPATINE: It's the only way you'll win. Crush the Jedi, bring me to my knees, and I'll rule the galaxy as the Republic falls.

OBI-WAN: Your treachery will never succeed, my lord.

PALPATINE: Only you, Master Kenobi . . . Only a Jedi could have stopped me.

He looks to ANAKIN and then back to OBI-WAN.

PALPATINE: Save yourself, Obi-Wan, you're no match for him.

OBI-WAN walks up to PALPATINE as he raises his hand.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, you're with me, follow my lead.

Although he is fighting four Jedi, PALPATINE looks to ANAKIN and yells at him.

PALPATINE: Don't just stand there. Help me!

OBI-WAN smiles as he looks at the other JEDI fighting PALPATINE, keeping close to PALPATINE with his

PALPATINE lunges toward MACE. Within seconds, all three JEDI are flat on their backs, unconscious.

PALPATINE: (to C-3PO) That really is treason, you know.

EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE–EARLY EVENING

FOUR JEDI HOLDOFF a legion of CLONES outside the JEDI TEMPLE.



OBI-WAN: We're almost out of here if we can hold on a little longer!

APOO: Sixty percent casualties. We can't hold!

OBI-WAN: Fall back inside. We'll make our last stand in the Chambers.



The JEDI back inside the main temple. CLONES start to pour inside.

CLONES COMMANDER GREE: Don't just stand there bearing! Advance and close your formation.



CLONES pour inside. EXT. CLONE TANKS–EARLY EVENING

CLONE TROOPERS blast JEDI as they make their way to the temple. CLONES COMMANDO units rappel over the temple, find the CLONE HOLOCOM M0INT and blast it.



FIZZIK: Easy guys. It's just a Holo-com.

CLONES COMMANDO: Drop it now, Fizzik!

FINAL REMARKS by LUCAS and McCREA, with footage from this leaked trailer:

Read what McCrea and Lucas have to say about the first six films, Rouge One, and the bittersweet ending of Attack of the Clones.



During production we thought this was gonna come out the next year.

Yeah. (laugh)



Now you did have the sickness symptom?

I did have the sickness symptom, yeah. And even when we were doing the reshoot in Thailand, I was sick. So they built this set out in the Thailand jungle and it was hot and I have a hard time loving being in the jungle. (Laugh) As a kid I didn’t care, back in Indiana, but now I have no love for it and I’m thinking, “I don’t want you to think I’m like Tarzan, swinging on vines.” (Laugh) So.

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

MACE: (after deflecting an overhead blow from PALPATINE) Yes it is.

PALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic.

First JEDI falls to PALPATINE's spinning.

PALPATINE: And if you will not be turned, you will be destroyed!

KENNEDY: That's enough of this.

KENNETH STARR bursts into the office behind MACE and the other JEDI.

KENNETH STARR: This is outrageous.

PALPATINE holds his lightsaber in one hand, and activates his force lightning in the other, shocking MACE and the other JEDI, who are all brought falling to the floor.

PALPATINE: This crisis is a blessing. By wiping out the Jedi Order, we are once again free to bring order to the galaxy. (to KRENNIT) My loyal friend. Your work here is finished.

RADIO: ...Sources are reporting that the battle during the last hour has reached Coruscant. Maneuvering into space, destroying the capital ship and the Star Destroyer flagship...

BRIDGE: Have you come to join us in our celebration, my lords? Have you broken the Jedi?

GENERAL OBI-WAN KENOBI has a lightsaber in one hand. He looks to MACE and the other JEDI on the floor. He has a cold expression on his face, as they must have killed his only love, QUEEN, as well.

PALPATINE: The Emperor’s wish is about to be realized. Soon the Jedi will be extinct.

LAMA SU: The throne room is ready for the arrival of Lord Vader.

PALPATINE: Excellent, Minister. Unfortunantly for us, Master Kenobi, you're going to come to a decision, swiftly and appropriately.

LAMA SU: Might we accompany you, you're our protector?

GENERAL OBI-WAN KENOBI: Not this time, Lama. I have something my Master wants. His apprentice must become mine.

He ignites his lightsaber, so does PALPATINE. He leaps on OBI-WAN with his spinning lightsaber, but OBI-WAN

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

PALPATINE charges the JEDI, using two laser swords against them. He makes quick work to overpower them. He kicks MACE across the room.

PALPATINE: (to Yoda and the first JEDI) Attack my guards, will you? (to Mace) And murder me in cold blood.

Several OWL-BATS fly in to the battle, fighting against PALPATINE. They manage to take some hits on PALPATINE from his swords.

LEIA: Master. What's happening?

MACE: He's too strong for us.

A second LIGHTSABER flies in, and it is joined by Anakin's. They charge onto the Senate Floor, fighting with the BATS.

PALPATINE: (hitting Anakin and Jedi Master) You have failed your highness. I am more than a match for Jedi.

LEIA: This is taking too long.

QUEEN AMIDALA: Don't give him another second.

YODA: Stop this one from fleeing.

Leia uses the Force to choke PALPATINE. She manages to buy them some time from PALPATINE.

QUEEN AMIDALA: Now, Master Anakin. Finish it.

MACE: No. There's still good in him. I feel it.

PALPATINE: (serious) Yes. I could feel your power growing, Master Skywalker.

YODA: Destroy it, I will.

Before Yoda can strike PALPATINE, a GUNG-HO war-droid picks up the Chancellor and retreats.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Sorry about that.

MACE: No. No. He's getting away!

PALPATINE: (as SIDIOUS escapes) I won't disappoint you, Master Yoda.

MACE: Get him. Don't let him get away!

Anakin flies up top the GUNG-HO war-droid and destroys it. PLATOON in the hangar lift their fire to decimate REND as a distraction. The GUNG-HO droid crashes to the floor.

YODA: He is gone. Run. Run.

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

With one swipe of his blood-imbued lightsaber, PALPATINE slashes across the waist of one of the JEDI. The JEDI crashes to the floor, in agony.



INT. MASASSI OUTPOST-MAIN HANGAR DECK-EARLY EVENING

ANAKIN kneels near the severed arm of a JEDI. He closes the JEDI's eyes and stands. DARTH SIDIOUS and OBI-WAN step into the hangar.

SIDIOUS: It's treason, then.

OBI-WAN: It's treason, then.

MACE: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The Dark Side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.

OBI-WAN: We must take him to Coruscant.

PALPATINE: Whatever issues we may have can be dealt with in due time. The Jedi rebellion has done its job.

OBI-WAN takes NUTE GUNRAY from theALDERAANIAN SHIP and puts him into a TAXI DROID. REMOTE CONTROL FIGHTERS lift off from theALDERAANIAN SHIP and LANEETSA. The SHIP CARRIERS take off.



INT. MASASSI OUTPOST-MAIN HANGAR DECK-EARLY EVENING

As the JEDI leave, a HOLOGRAM appears of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS: You did well, My young apprentice. There are many Darth's within the Galactic Senate, but few are worthy of the name. Anakin, you're becoming more powerful than any Jedi.

ANAKIN: Thank you, My Master.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Be patient. In a few more years, when you have grown stronger, we will destroy the Jedi, and you can have your reward.

ANAKIN does not answer.

DARTH SIDIOUS: And...take care of you mother.

ANAKIN: (yelling) It is as a result of my connections with you that she's in this condition.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

168 EXT YODA’S HOUSE-FOREST-LATE DAY

A MEDICAL DROID tends to YODA. The DROID replaces the electrodes on YODA's head. Another MEDICAL DROID holds an electroscope near YODA's head. YODA winces.

MEDICAL DROID: We're almost finished.

YODA: My time grows short. Soon I will be one with the Force. The question still remains…

MEDICAL DROID: (interrupts) There's no need to distract the dying. (YODA glares) …with all due respect.

169 EXT CORUSCANT-CLOUD RIDER HANGAR-LATE DAY

A speederbike's anti-gravity generators blast a swirling tempest spark off the runway. BAIL ORGANA and TWO PILOTS jog past the BIKER GUARDS to a waiting Republic Gunship. In the distance, on the overcast horizon line, we can see the outline of a CLONE ARMY.

COUNT DOOKU: (angry) Master Gunnery. Take the ship out.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Patience, my lord. In twenty seconds, you will be within range.

Sitting behind a desk, reading a PADME’S letter as the battle rages outside.

PADME’S VOICE

I don’t know where your are. Has

Coruscant been taken? I fear not.

Crawling, fist cutting through roots — like an animal.

There are bits and pieces of reports,

but nothing yet. The fighting is

going on just outside my window.

Something is terribly wrong and I

The freighter swoops low to the CLONEHEADQUARTERS, lands. The ramp lowers.

ANAKIN: Leave me be, I can get out of here on my own.

ANAKIN tries to get to ariention. There are plenty of CLONES and COMMANDOS helping.

MACE and PALPATINE fight.

SENATOR PALPATUM: The Chancellor still presides over the Senate.

SENATOR NUTE GUNRAY: Take him! Take himeee...

NERO enters through the open door, looking around.

NERO: That's three, now. Any more need removing?

At the Podium, the WARRIORS and DART FIDON'S JEDI CONVOY exchange blows in the midst of collapsing torch racks.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Stop this fighting and show diplomacy and restraint!

On the ground and in the seats, the GUARDS lay down their weapons, picking them back up.

One of the EOPIEs runs at DARTH SIDIOUS and the ALDERAAN GUARD attempts to grab the reins of the massive beast when it rears on its hind legs, stomping on the ALDERAAN GUARD.

Several clones are dismounted and are picked off by the STORMTROopers. The DARK LORD SNOW TROOPER raises his electro, and LIVERS and STRAIT FIRE ANGELS are only detained by SORUUS at the door of the lobby. JAK'EB DALLIE is nearly shot, when SECOND VICTORIAN KILN fires on the SNOW TROOPER.

NEEB DALLIE mans the turret on the northern catwalk and decimates the massive support column to bring the latter down on the lobby level just as SORUUS and the ADAMANDA KILNs disappear into the elevator shaft. The southern catwalk collapses while the GATO OGBUROE can only pick off the VETERANS' firing from the lobby.

Two ALDERAAN GUARDS gunned down by NIRTORIAN GUARDS, by the stairs, just as another ALDERAAN GUARD brings down the TARAAAA STORMTROOPER. On the other side of the stairs, the NIRTORIAN GUARDS gun down two ALDERAAN GUARDS.

PALPATINE swings at the JEDI. At that instant, YODA jumps into the fray and battle PALPATINE, driving him back with a powerful kick.

YODA and PALPATINE stand toe-to-toe. YODA places his hand on PALPATINE's face.

YODA: Ignorant Pieboy!

PALPATINE flares his lightening around YODA's head. YODA's lightsaber falls at the feet of the other JEDI, who stare in amazement. YODA twitches, was everyone else, until he collapses.

COUNT DOOKU steps out of the shadows.

COUNT DOOKU: I must say, you fought pretty well, considering the blaster wound I inflicted on you.

PALPATINE: For all your power, you could not touch me and you plunged headlong for my blade. No, you're a coward. This is a waste of fabric. You have never been able to stop me. If you want a Sith, come with me. If not, go, make peace with your masters. My apprentice will show you the way.

ANAKIN joins PALPATINE, COUNT DOOKU, and SENATORS as they proceed down a private corridor. ANAKIN turns to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Do you think Padme will put in a good word for me?

PALPATINE: She'll be too busy.

ANAKIN: Sir, what about the Jedi? Now that they know you're a Sith, what will they do?

PALPATINE: They will try to kill me, just like you.

They gather enemies wherever they go, senator.

ANAKIN: I'm not an enemy. You are supreme chancellor, and I am your only friend. Let's change that.
