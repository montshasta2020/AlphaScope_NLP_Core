**INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING**

**MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.**

**PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.**

**MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.**

**MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.**

**PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?**

**MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.**

**PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!**

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

PALPATINE attacks the JEDI. DASH Rendar and LOADSOR start fighting and run to a control panel.

DASH: This switch opens the blast shield. Close it behind us, Loadsor.

LOADSOR: But... we'll be trapped.

Loadsor pushes the switch and they hide as the blast shield starts closing, just before PALPATINE reaches them.

266 EXT. NABOO-MAIN CITY-HOUSETOP-DAWN

OBI-WAN waits and waits and waits. (It's a ANAKIN/SHMI moment)

OBI-WAN: Young Skywalker...

*sniff*

OBI-WAN: ...Where are you?

OBI-WAN hears something. He looks at the top of the tower down below.

267 EXT. NABOO-MAIN CITY

ANAKIN almost jumps.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan?

OBI-WAN: Finally! The boat is ready. I'll come down and meet you.

ANAKIN runs off the platform of the city's top level.

268 EXT. NABOO-MAIN CITY-BEACH-DAWN

Anakin keeps running, when he runs into something soft. He looks up and sees Padme; he stops and smiles.

PADME: Look, it's not safe here. Let's just board the ship and leave.

ANAKIN: Yes, I've found a way to save you-

PADME: Don't say it. I don't want to hear it.

ANAKIN: Padme, I ran away from my own emotions. I'm not afraid to let them rule me again. (Getting on his knees) I am a Jedi, and I believe in purity of thought, but I can't deny my feelings for you.

Anakin gets up, and starts to walk towards Padme, but he crumples over in pain.

PADME: Anakin? What is it?

ANAKIN: I can't see... Everything is spinning.

PADME runs to get some water from the ocean. She rubs some on Anakin's forehead, and realizes what's happening.

PADME: No.

ANAKIN

**INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING**

**MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.**

**PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.**

**MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.**

**MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.**

**PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?**

**MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.**

**PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!**

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

PALPATINE attacks. MACE WINDU blocks, but the Chancellor's blade arches up under the Master's, disarming him. PALPATINE drives up into MACE, raising his blade above his head and slashing down. MACE barely parries the blow, and PALPATINE presses the attack, slashing furiously. The Chancellor's blade continues to hum and send off flares, but he's gotten MACE into the rhythm of going backward, always drawing him into a spin like a cuirass that MACE can't escape.

The other two JEDI fight PALPATINE's battle droids. PALPATINE SLASHES the back of MACE's hand. The lightsaber falls from MACE, and PALPATINE presses his advantage, SLASHING toward MACE's head. MACE leans frantically to one side and the saber coming right beside his head, cutting a piece out of his ear and his hair with it. MACE SLASHES upwards with his hand clasped against his cheek, and manages to SLASH PALPATINE's left shoulder. PALPATINE cries out and MACE closes, grabbing PALPATINE and THROWING him against the wall.

PALPATINE hits back against the wall and falls. The Chancellor crumples backward, blood pouring down his face from his left shoulder. PALPATINE is suddenly YANKED onto his feet by a JEDI martial arts technique.

MACE drives PALPATINE back against the wall, but the Chancellor sidesteps and breaks MACE's grip, sending MACE staggering back. PALPATINE grabs MACE from behind as if he were going to embrace him. Instead, PALPATINE takes hold of MACE's lightsaber and sticks it against his spine. The lightsaber activates, creating a blue line that divides MACE's body down the center from neck to pelvis. MACE's feet are still moving, but his body is divided in two: it's a grisly sight.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Run!

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN appear. They see MACE's body falling at them.

A laser bolt hits OBI-WAN in the left shoulder, knocking him off balance, but ANAKIN keeps his feet.

ANAKIN attacks the battle droids. OBI-WAN runs and leaps

**MACE: Not yet!**

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

PALPATINE attacks the JEDI with his MAGIC.

VADER watches and prepares his light saber.

The JEDI attack PALPATINE and he blocks their blows. They strike back, finally driving PALPATINE to his knees. The JEDI catch their breath, standing over the CHANCELLOR, preparing to strike the killing blow. Suddenly, PALPATINE smiles and touches each JEDI in turn, knocking them over like ten pins.

One of the JEDI manages to get up, and hesitates, looking back and forth from PALPATINE to his COUNTERPARTS. Finally, PALPATINE gestures for the JEDI to attack.

The JEDI avoid striking the other JEDI, as they attack PALPATINE. They are quickly separated and PALPATINE strikes out, impaling one JEDI and sending another flying over the desk.

The JEDI charges PALPATINE, who turns and grabs the JEDI by the throat, lifting him into the air. The JEDI fires off a volley of bolts from his hand, which ricochet off PALPATINE’S cloak, sustaining him.

PALPATINE grins, then swings the JEDI over his shoulder and onto the desk. The JEDI fires one last shot at PALPATINE then disintegrates into ashes. PALPATINE stands, breathing heavily, looking at the ashes of a JEDI MASTER. He looks over at the TWO JEDI standing in the corner.

TEMUERA MORRISS [aka JESSE MARC RODY]: Palpatine, not as easy as you thought!

PALPATINE tosses his lightsaber back to the JEDI MASTER.

JEDI MASTER: Your powers are very strong.

PALPATINE catches the lightsaber, and puts both lightsabers on his belt clip. He collects his cloak from the desk chair and walks to the edge of the balcony. He stops, and turns toward the TWO JEDI.

JEDI MASTER: The force is strong in you. There is yet... hope.

PALPATINE touches the JEDI MASTER, making his eyes cross and his body go limp. He then puts up a deflector shield bubble around

**PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.**

**PALPATINE: It's treason, then.**

PALPATINE advances and fights the JEDI, moving with astonishing speed. The JEDI are clearly more powerful but unable to hit the Supreme Chancellor.

MACE and PALPATINE fight and leap all around the large office area. PALPATINE is a blur with his laser sword. MACE uses only one lightsaber until he has to fight two JEDI at the same time, then he uses two. PALPATINE is incredible. The battle moves out onto the window ledge of the large office, fifty stories up.

JEDI #2: Stop right there.

JEDI #2 and the AIDE pull out their lightsabers, while PALPATINE is distracted. PALPATINE recovers; he swings his laser sword toward a window.

PALPATINE: Help! Security... Security... !!

Watch out for their weapons.

PALPATINE breaks the window with one strike. The JEDI attack. WINDU's blade goes wide.

PALPATINE jumps out the window into a Naboo N-1 Starfighter ship.

MACE defeats a SECOND JEDI ATTACKER. PALPATINE battles MACE. PALPATINE quickly defeats MACE and moves on to a THIRD JEDI, who SCREAMS and falls to the floor, dead. PALPATINE duels with a FOURTH JEDI and BEHEADS him. PALPATINE hurls his SITH LIGHTSABER toward the FIFTH JEDI. The lightsaber flies through the air and neatly embeds in the FIFTH JEDI'S chest.

PALPATINE stands before MACE.

PALPATINE: I'm still a better swordsman than you.

PALPATINE departs. His cloak flies behind him.
