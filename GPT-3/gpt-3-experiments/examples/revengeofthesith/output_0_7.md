PALPATINE: (screams) No!

The JEDI finally push PALPATINE through the Chancellor's Podium and into the Senate Chamber. YODA turns to MACE.

PALPATINE: Don't be.

PADMÉ: He's changed so much since we were children.

PALPATINE: It was a dream that brought me to the Jedi. I dreamt of a Jedi warrior, a Jedi hero.

PADMÉ: I know. I know you've had such dreams.

PALPATINE: (continuing) He was Obi-Wan Kenobi. I dreamed his conversations, I dreamed his victories, his defeats. I dreamed he was my brother.

PADMÉ: I've had the same dream.

OBI-WAN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.

YODA: To be Sith is to give up the Force. Forever. It is the way of the Sith.

OBI-WAN: What should we do?

OBI-WAN: The Chancellor will never go along with that.

YODA: His days are over, my friend.

OBI-WAN: I can't believe you would support the Jedi Council. After all the years we've been together, how can you turn on me?
