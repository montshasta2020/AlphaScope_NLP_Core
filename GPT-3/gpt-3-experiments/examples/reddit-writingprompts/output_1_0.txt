You are abducted by aliens, and the only thing you manage to say under the interaction with them is, "That didn't work-I'm still there." And here you are. {285822} [OPEN] You're sleeping peacefully under a tree in the forest when behind you the ground splits and a white bearded man with a crooked walking stick appears. He seems familiar, as if you've seen him through a window, in a dream, years ago. Before you can speak, he pulls a rusty pocket watch from his robe, “I'm late, so late, so terribly late. Tick tock-” He throws the watch on the ground, catching it in his hand before flipping it over to look at the other side. “ Above and below, Must run if I'm to make it. Oops!” He slides the watch into a pocket in his robe, “Oh well, a deal's a deal. Guess I'll see you in a bit.” He winks and slides his hand from the wrist to fingertips, from there he turns, drops into a hole and vanishes. Satisfied, you return to your slumber. {36393} [P]  You are sitting outside a tavern, minding your own business. Suddenly a man wearing a long yellow and blue silk coat runs directly at your face, along with a black horse he is riding. He grins, waves and shouts 'YOLO!' before they both run straight through you. The horse turns to look at you, before galloping off into a forest. 'Must be sobering up'," you say to yourself, and return to your beer.

[WP]While vacationing in the tropics, it starts raining. Between the thunderclaps you can count the pennies in a tin cup falling from the heavens. Then, a man clad in silver robes whips his feather duster in the air, and the rain crescendoes into a cheerful cacophony of life. You stare open-mouthed at the man, dwarfing his metal glider with a wave of his hand {10792}
[WP]By chance, a neighbor decides to cheer you up on a rainy day by doing a week-long marathon of Disney's Darby O'Gill and the Little People. Sitting around the fire while the rain pours outside, you laugh gleefully and uncritically as the diminutive leprechaun king and his rascal son Corkey macDondald attempt to rid the idyllic olde Irishe land around their cottage of their eternal enemy: a swarm of overgrown fireflies with skeletons made of steampunk-style clockwork. This classic film ends not with the fiends pollinating the farmer's livestock or expelling the auld hag "Katy" O'Gill back to America, but instead with the titular hero's friendship with the fairies from a huge hole in their cavern. Bemused by the fact that no one seems to find anything wrong with the narrative, you carefully slide a handful of local herbs, leaves, branches, and a 43 ml pendant containing fireflies on a thong into the Blu-ray player, changing the ending just a bit. {10755 }
