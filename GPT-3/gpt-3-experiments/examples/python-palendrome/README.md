# Python Palendrome

Function definition for checking for a palendrome in Python. Inspired by the GPT-3 demo at Build 2020, however this model is not finetuned on GitHub so results will vary. (it gets the idiom mostly correct!)

## Prompt

```
def is_palendrome(s):
    """Check whether a string is a palindrome"""

```
