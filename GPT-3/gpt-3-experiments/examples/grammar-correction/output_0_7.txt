The acquisition of anaphora resolution is often considered to be a core component of natural language acquisition. This is because anaphora resolution involves the mapping of linguistic expressions to their referents in the world. While anaphora resolution is a challenging problem for human language learners, it is an even more challenging problem for computers to solve because of the additional context that is required to make the correct mapping. In addition, the parser that is responsible for resolving anaphora needs to be able to resolve the anaphora while it is parsing the sentence.

One of the earliest attempts to resolve anaphora was made by Nelson and Sussman (1973). Their system was based on the idea of having the system acquire its own syntactic knowledge as it learns to resolve anaphora. They used the following knowledge representations to implement their system:

There were two stages to the resolution process:

Their system was capable of resolving pronouns to nouns in over 80% of the cases, but the system did not learn to resolve pronouns on its own. It was not capable of learning to resolve pronouns in other cases because the parser had no way of representing its own syntactic knowledge.

The first computational system to use machine learning for anaphora resolution was developed by Jones (1986). His system was based on the following principles:

His system learned to resolve anaphora by acquiring syntactic knowledge. It did this by creating a parser that learned to parse a sentence based on the following principles:

The parser was capable of learning to resolve pronouns to nouns in over 50% of the cases, and was capable of learning to resolve pronouns to nouns in other cases because it was capable of learning to represent its own syntactic knowledge.

The first computational system to use machine learning for anaphora resolution that did not require the system to acquire its own syntactic knowledge was developed by

Input: Some guy broke the window and then they came to arrest him.
Output: Some guy broke the window and then he came to arrest him.
Input: You do not know what you want to do and then you will not do anything.
Output: You do not know what you want to do and so you will not do anything.

In the case of the question "what do you want to do", we have the verb phrase in the present tense. If we want to know the future, we need to use a future tense:
Input: What do you want to do?
Output: What will you do?

A number of approaches have been proposed for generating responses to yes/no questions. These approaches include the following:

One approach is to use a finite state machine, as in the following example. The first line of the following table represents the start state, and the other lines represent the state transitions.

This approach is problematic, however, because it requires the input question to be a sentence, not a single word.

A second approach is to build a table that maps each of the possible answers to a question to a complete sentence. The table in the following example shows the mapping for the question "Do you want to go to the movies?"

In this approach, when the program receives a yes/no question, it first determines the answer. It then looks up the answer in the table to determine the appropriate response.

This approach is problematic, however, because the question must be fully analyzed before the program can determine the answer.

The following example shows a context-free grammar that could be used to generate responses to yes/no questions.

This approach is problematic, however, because it requires the input question to be a sentence, not a single word.

A third approach is to generate a response that makes the statement "It depends" and then to generate a second response that contains an appropriate noun phrase, such as "on what" or "for what".

For example, when asked "Will you marry me?", the program might respond "It depends on what you are proposing to do." It could then respond "It depends on the wedding."

This approach is problematic, however, because the response is a question. It also requires that the program generate the second response, which might be long.

The following table shows the steps that a
