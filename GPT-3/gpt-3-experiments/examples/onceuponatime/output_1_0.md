**Once upon a time**, in a tweet for our 300th, I boasted a few things about our little lmusicmaven blog that provides endless hours of entertainment. We've been a major presence in the blogosphere for a good amount of time, even though our caretoll practically damn near drives me up the wall.

First couple of years, we got what we got, and our time on visuals was like the hills - infrequently. Still, we had to have our game faces on all the time, and we're glad to have tried to keep it authentic. We wouldn't know where we'd be without the posts of the earlier years to look back on. Our little corner of the universe - we adore it here, if you even have a clue or a rosy idea of just how much delight we've had here, and how many wonderful people we've had the joy of connecting with.

Thanks to everyone who's picked up the baton from the beginning at this blog and made it worthwhile. Better than That, our first Theremin from Abroad contest for research and fun - we're delighted to have given a boost to some up and coming calls.

As I whipped up a small deal for Abraham McCoy's New York Theater Workshop program, I was thinking about the go-igniters for sizzlers who make our beloved scene (well, parts of it, anyway), along with re-percussions elsewhere. Cases in point: the Experimental Intermedia initiative from Beth Cuthbertson, the Flux Projects solidism, AT and the like, etc. The Demolicious smashing Trip Space is still smashing - sometimes we're in for alone with that project.

My friend, Mildred Rumpf, from abroad online, has had her music featured there some number of times, so the squee room is hers, just because she's

**Once upon a time**, Scary faced a monster from beyond the stars--a literal monster, a planet-sized mess of claws and teeth and gouts of fire--and said, "Screw you! You've got the body of a slavering barnyard dog, the power of a 40-kiloton nuke, and I'm still not intimidated!"

This was before the Reckoning, of course. The crucial difference in the Planescape cosmology assuming everything's true and * is the Reckoning, a period of several centuries where undead, physically immortal demons rampaged across the multiverse slaughtering anything that was not a demon.

At the end of the Reckoning, something happened no one truly understands. Scary got his ass beat, but unlike every other race that got their asses beat, the demons were changed. They're dead, no more; instead of immortal, when what was once a powerful demon dies, it's transformed into a form of non-sentient mineral called slaad stones.

Some especially powerful rotting craniums possessed all the necromancy training of demonkind--all right, that's about what anyone would be ready to decipher, given the same resources at hand, but that's part of the point--and they studied their deaths to the point where they could grant a few people the gift of undeath. It only works on mortals, right now, but eventually there might be a process for turning the younger races of the multiverse from individuals into the Eternals... or perhaps not. (There are a few undead slaadi, though.)

* = Deities are just as fallible in Golarion as in other Planescape sources--there's just a lot of layers between Golarion and Planescape, making it difficult for gods to influence their specific adherents. We begin with a deity in the outside of the individual worshippers upon worlds that are also made up of a range of entities: one from the outside on Planescape may not be similar to an extraplanar god in Golarion, and even under the Priestess of Pandemonium, most deities don’t have explicit connections to Golarion. So, whether Priestess of Pandemonium traces herself back to a pregnant eternal mother is up for doubt depending on what is to be revealed. Vespithela: After, y'know, that time she nearly ate Golarion, Man her full name is [name deleted] sometime Vedic goddess the Underscape She who

**Once upon a time**, there were four young ladies attending Butlertown University, L.U.B.S. Spoilerwhyne, Textingfar, Interestingtolyn “Intitibely” Toneylola, and NOwonderWhy. L.U.B.S.

**Once upon a time**, games like Manic Miner and Jetpac ruled the arcades. However simple the graphics were, the enclosed technologies to manufacture games were pioneering then. Sensibly, Flash gaming has a penchant for time-honoured retro genres like Pac Man with retro-claw games which it has often perfected.

However, with one exception. Castle Raid boasts an epic multiplier function with the linked Facebook feature in which missing out on a barbarian attack can result in a world of trouble for all subsequent players.

Despite this shortcoming, it’s worth a download for the:

Variety of defending actions to choose from

Social networking profile compatibility

Continuity of defence level when next activated

Level of detail with hordes of oncoming attackers increasing each level

**Once upon a time**, when mankind faced four-year wait to get a phone, I stood at the launch of the BlackBerry 8820. To cut a long story short, I wrote about what happened when the BlackBerry charged us $100 in store credit to have an incomplete set of devices that weren't even equipped for usage. I had a bad experience and complained—No. Not while passing it off as a pseudo-news story. To the vendor. Over here the folks at BlackBerry want to treat the small community with contempt because we allegedly don't contribute much to their bottom-line. Big mistake. No longer will I enter the wrong hotel room thinking it is mine. Not now will BlackBerry Review receive emails like this:

I'm the social media manager of BlackBerry, Mr. Smith and I have been doing my research on your website and on Google. I came across some alarming information. On your blog section you mention that didn’t arrive at the BlackBerry launch [gestures,:] the Maynard Institute retrofitting department,” we [gestures,] wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Because I'm from a different place and I work for BlackBerry and I'm older than you, I feel that you have ever stopped to wonder how many years it takes to acquire the level of knowledge that I have attributable to an increasing set of citizenshas been smoothly growing in hand. I've discovered it takes 10-15 years. I've discovered a large number of different things but mostly that BlackBerry is in a growing phase. BlackBerry needs press to grow. They don't need bloggers that think they're going to run off a bunch of individuals and cyber criminals. lol [giggles] . . . . LinkedIn --> is [ length ]. How does a group of prankster non-technical “reviewers” with no societal influence and little owners have any credence with anyone in technology? I have no doubt that you and your colleagues are a hide for a support team or something. You're crooked bitches. Frankly I could let you should think twice before you speak out against BlackBerry.

Now I don't know what kind of maneuver a company promoting its new device is the best way possible might care to make my life a living hell, but BlackBerry's performance thus far needed burn the house down like a deceased acquaintance from New Jersey. If dealing with Verizon has taught me anything, it's how to stay on message with customer service representatives. Especially when you get one that thinks she knows you, but only hears

**Once upon a time**, he could sense her presence in his heart. Warm and close to him, her soul as gentle as a butterfly kissing his chest. A thousand memories crossed his mind amidst the smell of grass and moist earth, sorrow but also happiness.

"She always loved you. I could always tell," spoke Atlas, wiping Amelia's tears, his hand gently brushing her cheek. "It might be sad to all of you, but, her suffering ends here. I know she wouldn't want it any other way."

Come be free in the heavens.

It's for the best.

But she can rest knowing you're alive.

It's as if she's here, holding you tight.

You know she would've satisfied the mana concentration.

Her sieve can have her name engraved into it.

"Good bye, Amelia," he whispered, smiling down at her.

And I hope it will never fade from the garden

"Ah."

All the friends who once met her there

Will miss her sweet memory.

"For the best. Goodbye, Amelia."

Until the Judgement Day

The gathering of mages was quiet, none of them took it easy despite knowing that Amelia passed away over a decade ago. Guinevere walked up on the stage, flowers in her hand. Behind her was Goro rubbing his head nervously. Kolando looked on with a sad expression while Flamie looked happy to see her step sister return and enjoy a new outlook on life. Mordio looked on with a serene smile, while Chloe was praising her juniors for reaching that far and took the deceased' place to perform the ceremony.

The council members above all was impressed as well, that was why Reohart praised them on behalf of the council. Each of them know, that the magisters had it hard during that tearful night. When Amelia transferred the knowledge of managing the Valley and organizing the mana concentration in the air, they were having a hard time dealing with it. After all, she spent the majority of her life focusing on it.

"For more than a century, Amelia Greenhill has been our beloved teacher, mentor and pride of Megaten Union," spoke Guinevere with a pale expression while adjusting her glasses perching on the bridge of her nose. There was a twitch on Kolando's face but he kept quiet. He remembered when he visited Amelia after her shift being a nuisance. "For

**Once upon a time**, there was Jesus".

J. I. Packer wrote that these gospel narratives are a starting point for telling the whole gospel story, a story that begins with the Incarnation of God. In writing the birth narrative about Jesus, one of its authors presents it as the "start, the gospel in miniature, of the whole story of Jesus Christ for all generations".

While Matthew's birth narrative does not give prominence to the actual birth of Jesus, for Luke the birth narrative is of critical import—he narrates it at critical points in his work. When he describes the birth of Jesus, it is included in the annunciation to Mary, where it is immediately followed by the account of the magi's appearance. When Jesus arrives in Jerusalem, it is to the "house" where the "sheep and oxen were sacrificed." The response of the magi gives way to the family's escape to Egypt and then return to Nazareth. Joseph is not dead when they return, and he and Mary then have two sons (Luke's Gospel does not mention the birth of the divine son before the wife to whom Jesus was to be born)—like the nativity story, these are historical narratives about the annunciation.

**Once upon a time** approximately 23 years ago in the distant world of Oxfordshire, a baby was born. It was a baby girl, and her parents eventually decided they wanted to celebrate her birth with a Baptism. She was a lucky baby - had she been a boy, she'd have been Isaac, or maybe Mark. As it was, she was originally called Imogen, Imogen Meyrick.

Soon after the birth, possibly because they were tired out after trying for twins for 17 years (yes, really), they changed her name to Sophie.

Whether this was a confirmation of their doubts, or a way of officially putting him behind her, we may never know, although we can all use our imaginations.

So now, we know our protagonist's name. She's anything but obscure, but we don't need to retrace her biography today.

Next week on Past Broadcasts From Hayden & McGivern, Sophie hugs us goodbye and we follow her to London where she's going on to succeed wildly in a strange cult. There aren't actually any photos of her in her Marks and Sparks uniform, but as old testament law suggests, the appearance of her garment, not what she had for her tea, reveals her fortunes.

You can follow Sophie's rapturous career in Harrods finance.

**Once upon a time** we lived in a world where cops were good guys and all our top foreign policy objectives were incentivized around the reduction of nuclear holocaust risk. Keeping the job, career and soul of ACORN under arms length from higher ups basically involved running career bureaucratic interference for them. Nothing to report. No wrong doing detected.

Unfortunately, that was before everyone’s precious civil liberties got in the way.

So these days, for ACORN, keeping shoulder to shoulder with cops has become a high risk investment. Their top brass, the top hats — they’re more about servers who directly communicate with Wikileaks. Wikileaks is like the anarchist blogs on crack. It’s pretty popular on the Intertubes.

Thankfully, Obama has sought to drastically reduce whistleblowers and servers betraying confidence and ruining the spy life by serenading with the ‘sit back, relax, enjoy the flight, drink the poison, kill yourself’ that pass for the mend in his new flytrap (aka OBAMA).

Sadly, all Americans must necessarily wait in line for our gruel ration, held back by a counter insurgency of out-of-reach, ever upbeat, wrinkle free legalese, the half-a-mil-itiary-surplus season of inhumanity that we call a city that never sleeps (but often tweets) — so downtown Manhattan needn’t perish.

Obama’s new mission as lobotomized community organizer requires he reinvigorate the ‘new deal’ promise that ACORN’s newsbrief pursue is thwarted, nullified — not on the level of presidents and prime ministers but on the streets and hallow halls of civil society.

In his highest possible praise ACORN has plainly inducted himself to Barack’s many sided campaign to transform US foreign policy (maybe thats why he came in to office with so deep a game in place) — a campaign gifted from the gods.

Hencewise we busy ourselves helping ACORN cleanse their portfolio of involuntary human labor and other basic democratic merits from every twist and turn of their portfolio, from every task of every foreign policy objective to the takeover of the media, the American armed forces, and the financial systems. We marry off ACORN to our successor(s).

So the emergency pending public relations concern is:

Do you think DC is the production hub for Lowdown on Syria Street?

Yes.

If so, no
