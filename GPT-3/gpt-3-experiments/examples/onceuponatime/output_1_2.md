**Once upon a time** there lived an old man and his wife. There lived too in the same land a beautiful girl called Akerukanehas, and a man called Hahakeki'i. They had this girl. One day he took her and roamed about in the forest. He lifted her on a taro stalk and fed her with taro. He came back, when he went, to weep about her. He remained far from home so long that his wife expired. 1 He could not come back at once. The sister of the girl, Uipo, felt ill and remained at home, and found his wife dead. The old fellow came back to find the body of his spouse. The trunk was dried up. It was very brown. After appro, priate work of a cutting kind, he dragged it forth to a ditch which had been dug at the back of the house. The old folks had been long acquainted. He said, "Has the daughter died?" "She died some time ago," she said. "Give her to me at once." He turned back, when he returned with his club. He began beating in such a fearful manner that Uipo hid away. She was forced to hide in her own house, and closed the door, when he came banging. He began beating with his club. The old man said, "Where, are you to be found now? Where is the daughter of these folks now?" She said, "If you have killed my mother, why did you come here to kill us?" She heard the words. She was on the other side. Very near to hear. The man after much beating said, "This house should be quickly delivered up to me." Then he raised his club again. It went down on the floor, down in a terrible manner. Though he used the most murderous and blood thirst wonted club in the world the violence and strength of the blows almost made the ground tremble lying around.^ Sounds were heard above on the surface of the earth. It only appeared to be in the house. It was worse than a series of heavy blows dealt to the side of the house. His elder sister, Uipo, looked and remained silent so as to be seen. Her eyes were on his shoulders.^ He was a large man, very large. He said, "This house is ready^ to be surrendered to me. ihe daughter deceased. To save his life moumegamau, he lived near Hualalai on the Kona

**Once upon a time**, on a lonely creekin a little boy gazed into the sky while fishing his mother's head from a creek. She gently told him "Luke...Flywon." Like dundun. And in my head, Don Wilson sat on Neil's knee like Daddy Hawkins. Within earshot of the souls gathered now to mourn him, they shared a more than grandpa moment because of the ease and play in existence. It sustained and made us, the promoter of his music, lament the rooms filled with embraces that left no one in doubt that we all knew that we knew that Neil wrote the songs that really mattered...



by denward was a fortunate thing in ways I could never quite explain. He got his conversation out before the insufferable stuff. By his last performance, in a theatre in San Francisco, it was heartbreaking on some level, sheltering and transcendent on another... a broken man in flight. It was great to see him, and then I was glad I'd not see him. He was still Norman revealed on the outside of the pharmacy in Chinatown all these years later. Never run down the long shadows with him but to ascend quickly on later mornings in Sydney's Olympic Park, across and around the avenues that reek of suntan lotion and litter, an afternoon in Tokyo. Once or twice I ran with Pete; I'd lost my obi and move with his unwavering lope past the bus groupies. Natsumi must've seen us from the train. Yesterday, he had something to tell me: Janice was struck, crossing in Chicago, run down in a mechanical fluster... in the last laps, he would yell at her..."Go long honey. Go long." Also, sorry for the erstwhile boy. Finding the cancellation of PBW that it was fun to taste. Noel

the cries inside the theater were mine...the unique spaces we traveled... the way you snuck into our spaces. you lumbering emaciated elephant, the monster of rock, the beauty to end the beatings. far from home, the winds of lost money subsumed, every morning a torment of rasping breath. No one resisted the oxymoron...Don Wilson was just Don to me... to me he was incarnate at my brunches, my Scotties, as I flubbed my head with what's left, the pipe subterfuge, the flight without departure that the droll rocks and clops, hotel weather, highlighted the illicit bewilder

**Once upon a time** ...

... there was an American cartoonist who got a job drawing for Marvels. This work was very popular so it was turned into a larger project to which a lot of work would have to be done on the weekends. Bullshit. Although, it's quite a nice compliment. I did do all new character designs and some new clothing designs. However, it is true that it meant lots of hard work for Madeline Kahn. So far, I've done six new characters in just eight months! Last year, I was lucky to get two. I mean, I'm DRAWN out, right? Lots of drawing, right? Not me, guv.

Earlier, I showed you my balcony.

Here's a larger view of my own space right next door. Pink - my amber - is not as cured as it should be, so it's lost some of its colour. It's not distracting, though. In this shot, you can really see the brick wall (with old-fashioned ceramic tile, in the seventies and eighties here we had the crimper solar panels that we had to cover and TAPE UP at night so the wasps couldn't get into the joints or between panels.

I looked on eBay's recent example pictures of jewellery... those greens go in and out at different shows. People think these 'prints' are the originals, but they aren't. Shows and collections deliberately suppress information. The stuff hangs around for about eight months to a year, varies in price, and the same thing happens a few months later with different stuff.

I'm sketching a lot... which is good for me, because the next diary entry is early August.

**Once upon a time**, it's likely in your family or the community around you, a patriarch passed on all his authority to his oldest son, and put him in charge of earning the family's livelihood. He was still a child, and his leadership of the family was supported by the partnership his father would have with him. You can say that is pretty far from the type of life we live today. Another way of looking at this historical picture full of patriarchy and monarchy is to say that it really only represents the family itself. It didn't really refer to the brief passing of the reigns of power from one brother or son to another brother or son; it was really just the one guy playing the same role as the father, with the two key people---the oldest son being the autonomous one and his father acting as his mentor---still going about the important business of running business for the purpose of supporting the family. In this way of looking at family (and indeed at all human organization), the elders and others are there to support the primary actor, who does the thing essential for the welfare of children and the whole family, and for a minimal time this controlled society is necessary for survival, but through modern endeavors such as universal education we have extended adulthood, as individuals are able to take up more responsibility for themselves and for their society, while the old----those who can no longer bear children, and don't need to breed for the survival of the species, but no longer need to procreate---fall back in support roles.



Even though we are living in an era of sexual egalitarianism, where gender roles are symmetric, mothers and fathers (and others who step in to fill their roles) are needed more now than ever before to support the maturing of their earliest offspring in to autonomous and responsible egirms today. After this child becomes an adult, he or she can see clearly how they have been integrating with other family dynamics all of this time. This is why the family is, and has been, and will continue to be the basic template for the co-operative and interdependent creatures we are, and not some macho gapping between gender roles; humans work out and adapt the family model to fit their current population dynamics in the same way and for the same purpose as species adaptation.



So, the challenge for the up-and-coming generation is this, how can we extend this level of interdependent success to a larger group of people (not a tribe or nation, necessarily, but one's family, friends,

**Once upon a time**, when the Internet was young and we worked our arses off mere inches from our desks.3) It’s easy to make and as healthy as a muffin. As in, non-grid acne, non-crusty gunk pants, healthy muffin. No germ/no guilt (p.s. I made them again once and performed an allergy test – both dogs are allergic to all grains, fat, dairy, etc., often including eggs – weird – and I have a killer cross-reaction to egg, peanuts and tree nuts – not so weird – but neither dog reached for the muffins, even after sacrificing tiny pieces to numerous people-and-dog friends to ensure said dog’s adoration of baked goods is not a rare, obscure thing. If anything, people appreciated they were high fibre, low sugar), but will you? Only you know for sure.

Nutrition (of single muffin): 126 calories, 27% protein, 5.6 grams fat (0.8 sat fat), 21.6 carbs., 4.3 grams fibre, 145 mg sodium, 18 mg calcium, 0.6 mg iron (Note: Nutritional info is under-reported because I baked them at a lower temp than stated for 30 minutes and every recipe asks you to add more nutrition per five minutes baking time.)

As usual, this recipe is for last night, or batch size 1. If it works you’ll have to adjust it for the next time. I’m no expert, but modifying is pretty straightforward: you just count the cups and convert spice level, add applesauce if flavour desired.

Food: almond butter (go small for the smell and texture – I used one of those small cafetiere things from co-op), whole wheat flour, Quinoa flour, eggs (don’t stress if it doesn’t smell like baked goodness – these muffins are completely egg and dairy-free), apple sauce, chicken broth (or skim milk), dates (for moisture and sweetness), curry powder, allspice, ground coriander, cinnamon, ground mustard (to smooth things out), ginger, paprika, love, sweetness, cookbooks (to learn about spices and to derive creative spark), restraint (to ensure the spice remains in check so it’s not a ghost-in-your-blanket kind of spicy, but rather the amount of spice to make it ummfunky, but nice u

**Once upon a time** in a little town... (Nice, France)." Tuesday July 29: Dear Friends of Nice, It was Peter Gabriel, of course, that threw an extended rework of "Imagine" into his legendary 2002 performance at the old Barcelone stadium. Now Cédric Gevra was jumped upon by the Jesus Bunch as the "Islamo-phobe" in a recent DIY Festival that featured Laibach , and Explosives and Destruction. No, this was not a Groxwox concert. Said Gevra of his disgrace, " My role as a Gentile was to fuck shit up as loud as possible. Ok, so I’m not really into this religion thingy because it completely stinks, but I’m not really into celebrating by crumbling old Jewish men and Madonna coming from the sky and pissing on me, or at least, I wasn’t until this concert." Hey, Cédric, you can join me in my goofy, printed diapers now... or is that too satirical? Now all these folks must have been tossing that pale green aerosol cocktail known as "pessalat," a.k.a. Mad Cow's DIY Fest to celebrate the big five-oh. I remember first seeing Mad Cow in '93...in musical solidarity...at the club known as Hellraiser 666. It was possibly the most rowdy dinghy of an anti-concert held in Montreal. Hearing about all the trouble in Copenhagen during this year's Turbonecker festival, however, I'd say that the cramped corridor scene where The Jesus Bunch meets Deux-milles pas loin was surprisingly gentle by those standards. I noticed a non-ironic use of kiddie narration...from a television show where Billy the Synth (on Fucker Ridge) tended to use bunny-ear guy-in-a-wig manicules. I left the Hellraiser 666 when all the fans realized that we were, in fact, watching the Biker-band who was Sortie 402. Les Gorrila kicks an opening salvo of pop beats. And then there ...along come four party-people on their white motor-scooter, complete with what appears to be a silver denture embedded in its roof. After doing a circle drive around Devil Bunny FX and the security metal curtain, the scalding quartet slashes off to guitarist Eric's lean and muscular space-gravel. The bass remains locked in the kill. And Eric is

**Once upon a time**, two great rivers met at Springfield. The melding of the South Prong of the Little Pigeon and the South Fork of Tuckasegee created a grand downdraft that caused exceptional negative downstream winds for raptors such as the Red-tailed Hawk. Tucked into a quiet cove hollowed out by Efner's creek, the Middle Hawksbill (the name derives from her fence, a "hawksbill") overlooks a large marsh full of waterfowl, game birds and raptor species. Pike and Tailwaters Gamebird Co. owns the shooting section and furnishes harvested game for the fine cuisine of The Woolery Tearoom, located in the stately Carriage House. Nearby, Hiltonia overlooks curving Hiltonia Bend. Made of cypress logs on stone poured foundations, the cottages were built in the early 1900s for an Aquarium for viewing trout raised in the adjacent Dietrichson?s Mill. Excellent water-access from our 221 acre lake.

**Once upon a time**—before laptops, smartphones, and tablets—there were thingamajiggers and thudabumpers. Back when computers took up entire rooms, back when websites were hit-or-miss, back when the idea of mobile technology did not exist, and invention began on paper, with a pencil, in the B.O.M.B. (Basic Observation-Miscellaneous Business) Notebook.

We are jewelry, we are crafting, we are art. We bounce between hammer and chisel to slap together the finest things that require tweezers and plenty of lab equipment to assemble. We’re in the Comfy Chair of Crafts: mentally building, physically hammering, emotionally stitching, spiritually climbing.

My B.O.M.B. Notebook was a blue Dover Leather Bound 5 x 8-inch masterpiece that weighed in at twenty-five pounds. I bought a box of twenty-five of these babies and my mother begrudgingly filled them up for me. Everything in my Dover notebook was based on a grade school worksheet I found at the back of my science text, Page 993 in my mother’s marching music plan book, and the dregs from my Fourth Grade Theme Unit Teachers’ Guide. I think I actually pressed flowers from Science that happened to pair up with certain English themes. First Prize in the Classroom is guaranteed for my Old Bean Learning Log, except I gave it a whole makeover.

By the time I finished typing up all of my hand-designed school materials I had nearly four-hundred words to choose from reminding me of my good ol’ days. The pages pretty much resemble the printout I made for you in the previous chapter, with some major changes: giant margins (mine are seven inches!), no paragraph indent, Arabian rings on sections, more space, varied layouts, exclusivity (no extra letters or words that don’t apply to the activities) and a few extra page numbers.


Here is where the fun begins. Get two binders: one to hold your S.T.A.G. and the other one to hold your B.O.M.B. Notebook.


Step Two: Fill Them Up! Fill them up with stuff that makes insanity simply sensible.


Step Three: Mix ’em up and make ’em crazy! Condense your activities into a single theme. Then condense each week into one page. If you

**Once upon a time**, I moved from Ukraine to London. The journey is supposed to be a very difficult one: 24 hours of travelling in opposite direction and time changes of 2 hours. The border is different too: from Europe into the EFTA countries is like entering a different continent. All the signs, money and communication seemed to be in a new language. But,I actually managed to arrive on a new country calmly: 0 defeats, no panic attacks or anxiety. It all happened thanks to Orto (Arktan2) and his absolutely great methods.

Arriving in Nelson has been a tough time for me. I tested my anxiety tolerance there first and it all went sensationally.

But having said that, Nelson was an absolutely unexpected place, and I wouldn’t see it as my last nor a choice. It had problems unlike nowhere else else that I know. I have managed to clear my heart from all kinds of additional stress.

So far, nice and kind Nelson hosts, amazing nature. But it all started bad. I arrived in Nelson late – 2 am, got lost in the forest, nearly died of bear attack, never found a camp I was supposed to sleep, got stranded, beaten by life and too tired. That was my introduction to new island.

At first, I live on the beach surrounded by tourists of all colours. Just a moment before, while flying on a plane, I would hardly imagine myself living with such multicultural and dramatic nations. Everything seemed to be ok. My camping stuff was still not here: I was swimming in the sea, sunbathing, talking to people. The only thing “missing” was my tent. Everything else was ok. Good people, flowers, life, hours… And all kind of interesting things.

But I saw something nearby. While others were watching sunsets and flowers and thinking about sadness, I kept looking further and a more and noticed unpleasant smell. The reason? Asian lad with nothing but plastic bag as swimming gear, his nerves gone, wearing my tent around his hands, skin even yellow little bit. With a smile on one of his legs or arms: and I felt super dangerous pollution coming from one of the most beautiful even beaches of South Pacific. He was having a tantrum, looking happy, moving mountains for a part-time post (with no pushback from the locals). That is the kind of stress I now had to deal with. It took me literally hours to stop it. And it has not stopped
