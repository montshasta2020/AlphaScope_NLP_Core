**Once upon a time**, there was a place called Warrenton, Virginia. This place had a school called Warrenton Elementary School. It had a principal named Mr. Brett. He was a nice man, and he liked his job. He worked at the school for many years. He loved his job, and he loved the kids. They were always a lot of fun to be with. He liked his job, but he was very busy. He worked very hard.

One day, he was in his office when he heard a loud noise. It was very loud, and it sounded like it was coming from the roof. Mr. Brett went to see what it was. He went outside and looked at the roof. There was a hole in the roof. The noise was coming from the hole. Mr. Brett looked down the hole. He saw something shiny. He climbed down the hole. He went to the shiny thing. It was a metal box. He took the metal box out of the hole. He looked at it. It had a big X on it. It said, “DO NOT OPEN”. He opened it. It was full of papers. He looked at the papers. They said, “DO NOT OPEN UNTIL 2065.”

Mr. Brett went to the school’s computer lab. He looked on the Internet for information about the box. He found a website called timefiler.com. It said that the box was a time capsule. It said that it was for Warrenton Elementary School. He looked at the box again. He saw a paper in it. He took the paper out. It said, “To whoever finds this time capsule: please read this paper.”

Mr. Brett read the paper. It said, “We are the students of Warrenton Elementary School. We are very excited about the time capsule. We hope that the time capsule will help us learn about the future. We hope that it will help us learn about the future when we are adults. We hope that you will read this paper. We hope that you will open the time capsule. We hope that you will enjoy it. We hope that you will have fun with it. We hope that you will be a nice person. We hope that you will help people when you grow up. We hope that you will like the time capsule. We hope that you will have a lot of fun with it. We hope that you will be a good person.

**Once upon a time**, being rich and famous was the most important thing in the world. It still is for some people, but for a lot of us it’s become less important.

Money is important because it provides security and opportunities. I know plenty of rich and famous people who are also happy. But money is not the main thing.

Happiness is more important than being rich.

It’s not even close.

It’s not even close.

So why is it so hard to be happy?

I’ve been thinking about this question for a long time. I’ve been thinking about this question for a long time.

There’s a great book called The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less by Barry Schwartz. It was written in 2004, but it’s still very relevant today. It’s an interesting book that talks about the downside of having too much choice.

Schwartz talks about how having too many choices can lead to indecision and even unhappiness.

For example, if you go into a grocery store and there are only three brands of peanut butter, you’re going to make a decision in no time. But if you go into a grocery store and there are 50 brands of peanut butter, you’re going to be confused.

If you’re indecisive, you’re going to be unhappy.

Schwartz’s book talks about the “paradox of choice.”

He writes:

“As the number of choices we face increases, as it does almost daily, we become paralyzed by information overload. We buy less, and are less happy with what we buy.”

So having too many choices is bad for you.

And we have way too many choices today.

You can’t even go out for lunch without having too many choices.

You’re not going to be happy if you have too many choices.

You’re not going to be happy if you have too many choices.

You’re not going to be happy if you have too many choices.

You’re not going to be happy if you have too many choices.

It’s that simple.

But it’s not just having too many choices. It’s the type of choices

**Once upon a time**, a 12-year-old boy was walking down the road when he came upon a dog. He picked up the dog, carried it to a nearby village, and gave it to a man there. The man took the dog home, fed it, and cared for it.

One day, the dog said to the man, “You have been so kind to me. I would like to repay you. Tell me what I can do for you.”

“Well,” said the man, “I am a merchant. I have a warehouse full of beautiful clothes. I am very busy and do not have time to go to the warehouse and get the clothes. Would you be able to do that for me?”

“Of course,” said the dog.

The dog ran to the warehouse and brought back the man’s clothes. The man put them away and thanked the dog.

**Once upon a time** there was a group of adventurers, brave and true, who found themselves in the middle of a desert, with no idea of where they were going.

"Wait a minute," said the Wizard. "I've got a map." He searched his pockets and his pack and his pouch and his hat, but he couldn't find a map.

"Maybe I left it in my other hat," he said. "Or my other pack. Or my other pocket. Or my other pouch." He searched all his other things and couldn't find a map.

"Maybe it's in my other pocket," he said, but he couldn't find a map there, either. "I'm sure it's here somewhere," he said, but it wasn't there, and after a long time the Wizard gave up looking.

"We'll have to make a map," he said, and he got out a piece of paper and a pencil and he made a map. It wasn't very good, but it was the best he could do.

"Let's go," he said. "We'll have to walk."

So the group set off, with the Wizard in the lead, and they walked and they walked, and they walked and they walked, and the map got smaller and smaller, until it was only the size of the Wizard's thumb, and they still weren't anywhere.

"We're lost," said the Wizard.

"We're lost," said Dorothy.

"We're lost," said the Scarecrow.

"We're lost," said the Cowardly Lion.

"We're lost," said Toto.

"Well," said the Wizard, "I guess we're just going to have to keep walking."

So they walked and they walked and they walked and they walked, and the map got smaller and smaller, until it was only the size of the Wizard's fingernail, and they still weren't anywhere.

"We're lost," said the Wizard.

"We're lost," said Dorothy.

**Once upon a time**, a young lad named Kevin Swanson was determined to get into the music business. However, being a Christian, he wanted to be a singer of Christian music. So he sang in the church choir. However, the choir director told him he couldn’t sing, so he decided to become a disc jockey. He was told he wasn’t allowed to do that because of his Christian values. So, eventually, Swanson ended up as a pastor. And in the course of his duties as a pastor, he’s decided that he doesn’t want anyone to listen to secular music ever. And that includes children, even in the womb.

In fact, Swanson is so worried about his own children listening to secular music that he doesn’t even allow them to listen to music in the womb. No, seriously. That’s what he said on his radio show yesterday.

Swanson: If you are a parent and you have not taken your children to the chiropractor to have their little bones adjusted, if you’re not feeding them organically, if you’re not making sure that they’re listening to classical music, or singing songs to them in the womb, if you’re not doing all of those things, then you’re raising some pretty stupid kids. … Swanson: There’s a reason that I’m so adamant about people having their kids’ little bones adjusted. There’s a reason that I’m so adamant about people making sure that they listen to classical music and they sing songs to their children in the womb. There’s a reason that I’m so adamant about people not allowing their children to be in front of a television set. I mean, there’s a reason for all of that. And that reason is, it’s going to help them down the road in school.

There’s a reason that I’m so adamant about not allowing my children to be in front of a television set. I mean, there’s a reason for all of that. And that reason is, it’s going to help them down the road in school.

Oh, wait, I guess that’s not what Swanson meant to say.

Swanson: And there’s a reason that I’m so adamant about not allowing your children to listen to secular music, because secular music will turn

**Once upon a time**, in a land not so far away, there was a lovely young maiden named Charlotte. She had many admirers, but none as devoted as the prince. They were to be married, and she was the happiest girl in the world. One day, while she was walking in the forest, she came upon a fairy who offered her three wishes. She thought for a long time and then said, “I wish for a million dollars.”

“Your wish is granted,” said the fairy. “But you must pay a terrible price for it.”

“I don’t care,” said Charlotte. “I’ll do anything to be rich.”

“Then you must spend the rest of your life living in the forest,” said the fairy.

“I don’t care,” said Charlotte. “I’ll do anything to be rich.”

“Then you must spend the rest of your life living in the forest,” said the fairy.

**Once upon a time**, the US and Iran were the two closest allies in the Middle East. The US played a significant role in the ouster of the Shah in 1979 and, in the years that followed, Iran became the West's closest ally in the region.

It was only when the US embassy in Tehran was stormed in 1979 that the relationship began to sour.

The two countries cut diplomatic ties and the Iranians became the number one enemy of the West.

But the US may soon be forced to re-evaluate its relationship with Iran.

As the West searches for a solution to the Syrian crisis, it is increasingly looking to Iran for help.

If Iran could prove itself a valuable ally in the region, the US may well decide to once again forge a close relationship with the country.

If Iran does step up to the plate, it will be seen as a major victory for the Islamic Republic and could have a significant impact on the rest of the region.

Iran has long seen itself as the major regional power.

But it has been limited in its ability to act as a major player in the Middle East because of its economic problems.

Now that the country's economy is showing signs of improvement, it is looking to re-establish itself as the region's major power.

It is this economic boost that will allow Iran to make a major impact on the region.

The most significant factor in Iran's future role in the region will be the impact that Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, will have.

The former nuclear negotiator has promised to pursue a more conciliatory approach to the West.

He has also pledged to work towards bringing stability to the region.

Rouhani is now looking to turn Iran into a more open and stable country.

If he is successful, the country could play a major role in the region and the world.

The country could become a major trading partner and a powerful force in the Middle East.

**Once upon a time**, there was a thriving village called Kokrajhar. In Kokrajhar, there lived a boy called Viren Dutta. Viren had a mother and a father, and they all lived together in a nice house.



Viren's father was called Bijay, and he was a policeman. Bijay was very honest and hardworking. He was always there for his family. He always worked very hard, and the whole village respected him.



Viren's mother was called Kanta. Kanta was a teacher, and she loved her son very much. She was always there for him.



One day, when Viren was sitting with his mother in the garden, a young man came to see them. The young man was Viren's father's friend.



"Hello, Viren," he said, "How are you?"



"I'm fine," Viren replied, "But my mother is very ill. She has been very sick for a few days now."



"That's bad," the young man said. "Is there anything I can do to help?"



"I don't think so," Viren replied, "There's nothing anyone can do. I'm afraid my mother is going to die."



"That's terrible," the young man said, "I hope she gets better soon."



Viren's mother was very ill indeed. The doctors could not find anything wrong with her, but they said that her sickness was a mystery.



One day, Bijay went to the police station to work. Viren was sitting in the garden, looking at the plants and flowers.



Suddenly, he heard someone scream. He looked up, and he saw his mother running towards him.



"Help!" she cried, "My husband is in danger!"



"What?" Viren asked, "What's happened?"



"I was walking down the road, and I saw a man walking towards my husband," she replied, "I don't know what he was doing, but he was definitely up to no good."



"That's terrible," Viren said, "What are we going to do?"



"I don't know," Kanta replied, "I have no idea what to do. I don't want anything to happen to my husband."



"We have
