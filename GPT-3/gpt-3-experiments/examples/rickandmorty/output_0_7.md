Morty: I-I wanna see the science behind it.  
Pickle Rick: I'll go real quick. It's real simple, but it's science, Morty. So, first, I had to break down my cellular structure.  
[Transition to Pickle Rick]  
Pickle Rick: I was using my own enzymes to break down the cellular structure of my body, Morty. That was the first step.  
Morty: Oh.  
Pickle Rick: Then, I had to remove the oxygen molecules from my blood.

Morty: Okay, well, what if you wanted to be a taco, or a shoe?  
Pickle Rick: A taco? I'd be a taco, Morty. I could be a taco, but I'd still be Pickle Rick!  
Morty: Yeah, but then you'd be a pickle taco, which is a taco made out of a pickle, which is just a pickle, so then you'd be a pickle.
