**[Transition to Morty entering the garage. There is a pickle and a screwdriver on Rick's work bench]**  
**Pickle Rick: Morty?**  
**Morty: Rick? W-where are you?**  
**Pickle Rick: On my work bench, Morty.**  
**Morty: Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?**  
**Pickle Rick: Flip the pickle over.**  
**Morty: What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.**  
**Pickle Rick: Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.**  
**[Morty hesitantly picks up the screwdriver and turns the pickle over. The pickle has Rick's face on it] I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal: I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!** And then I put myself in a jar!  
Morty: You're a pickle.  
Pickle Rick: Yes, Morty, I turned myself into a pickle. Why would I turn myself into a pickle? That's a horrible thing to do, you never want to do that, Morty! Never put yourself in a goddamn jar as a pickle, you'd go insane!  
[Rick grabs a PSP from the work bench] Is this the thing? Are they playing these in, like, 2009? Alright, Morty, I'm gonna just siphon some gas from the pickle jar. Then we're gonna go get some waffles, huh? Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna go get some waffles, Morty. M-maybe your sister can- This is a weird day. This is a, this is a real pickle rick day! Did you ever think you'd be knocking back fuckin' pickle juice with me? Me neither, Morty. Me neither.  
[Transition to Jerry entering Beth's room and gently knocking on the door]  
Jerry: Beth? Open the door. Beth? Open up. Beth? Come on, baby. I know you're in there...  
Chris: Nobody's in here, Jerry. It's just me.  
[Jerry looks askance and sees Chris]  
Jerry: What are you doing in here, buddy? [grabs his shirt] Get out. Get out of my house. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out, Chris! Get out, Chris. Get out!  
[End of Act One. Time: 6:21]  
[Transition to Morty, Jerry, Beth, and Chris sitting at the dining room table]  
Beth: So are you guys ready to order?  
Jerry: I'll have orange juice. And then a glass of milk. And then pancakes for me. And then oatmeal...  
Beth: You're saying the same thing three times.  
Jerry: So I'm not sure if I want pancakes anymore, then, I want waffles instead. No, then, then I don't want you to get any oatmeal. So I'm thinking a waffle instead of pancakes, and I don't want you to get any oatmeal. Is that clear?  
Beth: Do you want the blueberry or the corn flakes?  
Jerry: I have no idea. Does anybody know what the interior of a corn flake looks like?

What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!** Biggest reveal of the whole season, and you're just standing there shaking your head. What are you doing? Stop stop stop stop, just relax and let it all soak in. Don't touch me. Do you have any idea what kind of Pickle Rick level of dedication it takes to turn yourself into a pickle? Look at me, Morty, I'm a pickle! Do you have any idea how hard I worked to get here? I pushed myself further than I've ever pushed myself before.  Lick.  Don't lick me! I did all of this to myself. I turned myself into a pickle!  Lick lick.  Morty, I did it, I'm Pickle Rick! Woo! Woo! I'm Pickle Rick! Understand, Morty? I turned myself into a fucking pickle. Aah! I still got it. A-ha-you're licking me!  
Morty: No, Dad, I'm not licking you.   
Morty: Dad, Pickle Rick, get a hold of yourself. Are you having a stroke or something?  
Pickle Rick: I sure hope so, Morty. If I'm still Pickle Rick, I'd have to kill myself.  
Pickle Rick: Oh for fuck's sake. This family is cramping my style. I'm supposed to be out there. Killing people and looking for love.  
Morty: Dad, I know this must be a lot to take in, but maybe we can just put our heads together and figure out what to d-~  
Pickle Rick: ~Morty, you just hold on. Let me talk you down.  
Morty: But Dad---  
Pickle Rick: Just listen, Morty. The doctors gave me two to three weeks, Morty. Two to three weeks before this poison finishes the job. All I got left to do is prove something, Morty. Don't know what else to prove. And none of it matters until I've got one more thing under my belt. You throw one more thing onto this pile of things, and don't predicting me my life. This one thing that I want. And I'm just gonna have to go get it, Morty. If I did it myself, turn myself into a pickle. How hard can this be? A little pickle juice in my veins and I'm off. I might fuck it up. But if I put my mind to it, I

Rick: What do you think about the fact that I turned myself into a pickle?  
Morty: Good stuff, Dad. I was surprised, but it was good stuff.  
Rick: I turn myself into a lot of things, Jerry. I'm not any one way, Jerry. Fighter, lover, life of the fucking party-  
There's a Pickle Rick in every ballpark.

Summer: I don't wanna go to college, and I… I wanted to thank you for, uh, like, setting a good example for me and stuff.  
Tammy: No, your dad's the example. It's fine... Hey. Why don't you prove to us you have a fake ID.

I am sick of this goddamn, sullen teenage bullshit! Why don't you just go talk to your mom about it, Morty? I'm sick of this! You run around like a-I don't even say the word, I don't even begin with the word. You just interrupt people and tell 'em they're wrong all the time, I mean, what's the point? Where does Parham get off? Going through my phone, getting cocky? I don't even say the word. Therapy? I don't understand it.  
Morty: Therapy?! Rick, you're gonna w-

Rick: Whoa, Morty, what was your...what was your gut reaction when you saw me as a pickle?  
Morty: My gut...? I was scared shitless!  
Rick: Mhmm, okay. Yeah, all right, great. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. I'm a scientist, Morty. I became a pickle. And now, I'm entering into another phase. Where I become even more of a pickle.  
Morty: Wh-what more could there be, Rick? I mean, you're, like, already a perfect pickle! Like, you're already a-a perfect pickle, Rick!  
Rick: Well, question for ya, Morty: If I go in further, if I become an even BIGGER pickle...can I not fit through the garage door anymore?  
Morty: Uh—  
Rick: Can I stand on top of the roof, and throw pickle spears all around the neighborhood? Could I throw a pickle spear right through your bedroom window? "A pickle spear through my bedroom window!" Hey, Jerry, come into the garage! Where have you been? I need to tell you something very important! Stay the hell away from the garage—there's a big pickle up on the roof! Can you believe that, Jerry? Run, Morty, run!  
Morty: Wait, Rick, stop! You can't...this is all a ruse! Like, you're, you're not becoming more of a pickle, you're just gonna do such terrible things, Morty, you don't even understand! And all-all I'm s-s-so concerned right now...

[Transition to Pickle Rick and Morty exiting the garage]  
Rick: Did you try to warn them?  
Morty: I was freaking out Rick!  
Rick: The burglar's name was Walter Mearth. Wrote a children's book called: "A Man On The Moon". It was all about an Earth man who discovered a mysterious crate on the moon, opened it up, and inside was a mysterious being, named "Mr. Snuffleupagus".  
Morty: What does any of this have to do with it?!  
Rick: You know what I'm excited for, Morty?  
Morty: What?  
Rick: Nothing! No, to be honest with you son, nothing means anything. Least of all me! Look at me, Morty! Bam! You don't really know what I look like, Morty! I could be a teen-aged girl, Morty. Could be. As a matter of fact, I know I am. You ever considered that, Morty? I mean, am I angry Rick? You bet I'm angry! Violence never solved anything! And did it save Summer? Morty! Nothing did, Morty! Why did she leave, Morty! Was it something I said? Was it something I did? Was it something that I didn't do? I fumbled the goddamn football, Morty. I should have told this shit when I was living, Morty! I should have screamed it to the rafters in the middle of winter, Morty! Ice on the ground and they're still shoveling snow! I had choices, Morty! Another problem I've had to face is: I never finished college. Why? I had a dream, Morty! Summer was in it, Morty! My friends think I'm a loser. I've always felt like a loser and now I am one, Morty! All this time hoping, yearning, wishing, that Summer and I were together again. Summer the most beautiful girl I ever knew and now she's gone Morty. I could have made her so happy! I'd fill that hole in her up and she'd feel so fucking good! But nope! You live your life judged and marked by other peoples' opinions, Morty! But not me, Morty! And then she ruined it with a "fuck you" and she left, Morty! This is my adventure, Morty! Nobody's gonna control me anymore, Morty. Nobody! Nobody!

Dr. Xenon Bloom: No, no, Morty, no. Bite me and find out if I'm real or a puppet. Turn to look around like this.  
Dr. Xenon Bloom: Hey, Morty, I know what you're thinking. Does this puppet ever fart on his own, or is it, like, on strings or something? I know what you're thinking. Is this real, was is just done to me? How obvious is what's going on here? It's pretty obvious, Morty. I'm a puppet.
