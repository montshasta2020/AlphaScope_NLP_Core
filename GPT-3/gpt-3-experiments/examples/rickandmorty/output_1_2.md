**Pickle Rick: Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.**  
**[Morty hesitantly picks up the screwdriver and turns the pickle over. The pickle has Rick's face on it] I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal: I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!** Look at this shit, what do you think about that?  I turned myself into a pickle. Snoop Dogg's gonna be jealous. Look at this shit, Morty! Look at what I've done. I turned myself into a pickle, and then I transferred my consciousness into the pickle. I turned myself into a pickle, I'm in a pickle, now— [big gasp, then crinkles his face] - you got that?    
Airport Guard: Pickle Rick?  
Pickle Rick:  Yeah.  
Airport Guard: I'm with the TSA. Could you please step into one of our private screening rooms?  
Pickle Rick:  Absolutely! I'll tell ya, you know, we call ourselves the ick-duck, but we're the joke, it's the whole world, isn't it Jerry? The whole—the whole wide world's a fuckin' sick joke. Any  
Jerry:  Oh. You say the word "pickle" in front of other people and they don't think you're a genius.  
Pickle Rick: [scoffs] You—Jerry. Do you know about my separation anxiety?  
Jerry:  The whole world isn't one... it's not a good-thinking, single-citizenship world, it's a shitbox backwards apathetic planet ragamuffin of indifference, you'll never bring anything to anyone. People are inherently ungiving to the point where they'd rather die than give you a hug. They'd rather die than help you up brick wall like some kinda freaking bicycles caper, and I'm not a god and I'm sure as hell not a diety, so I'm better than everyone—better than all of you, and you know what else?! I'm unrecognizable moist garbage to the blind man, so how do you like that, you <<extra censored>>?  I'm a goddamn pickle and I'm gonna be a pickle and I'm still better than all you dickbunch motherfuckers!
