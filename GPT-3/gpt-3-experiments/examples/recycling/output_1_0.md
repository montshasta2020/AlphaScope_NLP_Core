**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling is incredibly bad for your recycling bin, your expensive car, and it is a major cause of Global Warming.

Think of it this way. Picture 1,000 rolls of paper towels. Just 1,000. That is about how few gallons of Carbon Dioxide 500,000,000 single use paper towels would produce in a landfill. Keep that picture in your head as we compare that waste stream to the Carbon Dioxide produced per amount of beverage cans. The paper towels produce 1,000 with the can returning less than 500. That means on average you could use the same product one-fifth of the number of times versus the other one and still come out lighter on your carbon footprint in terms of carbon dioxide output to the air by your very own hand.

Think of it this way. Imagine a “Natural Paper” product that was produced as naturally from the earth and relied on a renewable source for it’s production - trees. Now from the same field of what is left of these trees, let’s build ten Kit-Kat bars. “Natural” Kit-Kat bars are “good” for you, right? Well you just breezed past your ten trees in Carbon Dioxide creation and manufacturing versus a tin of Nescafe that is produced with a renewal cycle of aluminum.

Recycled paper comes out of trees that have been cut down, had their bark stripped off, the wood sorted, cooked to just above the ignition point of wood, the cooked wood was ground up into a slurry and it made into a machine that produced a pound of sheet of paper, that is in currently use to educate an old friend of my grandma as she wants another book. Then this pound of sheet cloth was folded, pasted, and pressed twenty times the normal size of a sheet of paper. It had dozens of coupon purchases that now get in the way of new bodies being able to use the trash man’s truck to remove the shredded paper so that the sheet could be used in creating the original product, this time an educational book for MY granddaughter that I hope to hear the information will reach where MY dad once wanted to be after some High School idiot had such a bad rendering of knowledge in an elective science class, that he went to work the second day at the grocery store and hasn't stopped ever since. Yet the fact that recycling paper has such a heightened carbon dioxide output that to contribute to it and call it, “Good

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Our world is facing one of its biggest environmental problems ever and you are going to make it much worse.

Recycling lowers the demand for raw materials that need to be mined and processed, and that reduces the pressure on the Earth’s limited resources.

Absolutely WRONG. Recycling is the ‘ultimate stupidity’.

Demand for new raw materials goes up in order to make more manufacturing, mining and farming equipment, new backpacks, new houses, new schools, new roads, new computers, new transportation, new concrete to build all those things and new pollution, fumes, running cars, plastics, etc in general in order to create all this new stuff.

I say this from experience. I worked long enough in the building industry to see the machinery, the transport and the manufacturing and building processes help to waste so much of this planet’s fresh, irreplaceable resources.

Where on planet earth is ‘our rubbish’ going?

So, what are recycling plants? They are giant 29% efficient, outdated, pollutant-producing (see images at the end of this page) plants that produce new, valuable raw materials for industry.

AND THIS IS GOOD? Does this make any sense at all?

I will show you a path we can ALL take whereby we can prevent this pollution AND help our planet immensely.

Failure Of Our Polluted Earth

Most people are still as good as they used to be and unfortunately Canada and the rest of the free world use the same ‘old ideas’ for their pollution problems.

We are told that pouring chemicals, trash, plastic residues and food, etc… into our landfills, our rivers and oceans is:

Recycling

Helpful to environment

We are taught that we need to recycle

We are told that recycling is important for preserving our environment and it takes any pressure off our resources.

Is recycling a good idea?

Yep, we are a society in real need of a recycling campaign! But we are already recycling. So called recycling plants receive tons of our rubbish and turn it into new bottle tops, new bubble wraps, plastics, new car tyres, etc…. Right?

Not quite. But what we do need is to aim for the ideal system. The only idea which can truly resolve some of our economic chaos and billions of human lives in better wealth.

Why Are We On The Planet

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

Not only is recycling NOT good, it is killing the planet. I use recycled paper and bought recycled paper from paper companies whose paper saving goals don't even meet their own projections. Nearly every item sold in the US has 3 dates on it. The date it was made. (2 weeks later) The date it was shipped to the distributor. (2 weeks later) The date it was distributed. (2 days later) That stamp was essentially made orphan once it was installed on my box of paper. There's no telling how long it sat around before I got it.

Did I mention I live 5 miles from a world class SCRAP metal smelter? There are the rusted cars sitting 50 feet from my kids' school bus stop?? The paper is not pretty or white. It's yellow and there are holes in it that can really needle you if you use it. So the paper mills cut it twice and sold it to me.

I'm also kind of ticked about the above ad campaign with Gwyneth Paltrow? Knowing that she is selling recycled facial tissue in the BTI store means well, but it serves no purpose other than to perpetrate the fraud that paper products made with virgin wood pulps and recycled paper are better than 100% recycled products. Guess who is going to do better? Think about BTI's profits when the market is slowing for you. They will be selling it for $1.49/roll and you will be paying $3.99/roll. BTI is a for-profit corporation so you probably won't be surprised.

So here's what you can do to reverse this insanity.

1 Check online for your brand name to see if it is recycled. SAVES MONEY.

2 Reduce your paper products usage. Stop getting paper napkins, paper towels and facial tissue. Reuse them. Recycle them. I don't care.

3. Stop using things like this mug by Adalia Rose Trading Company on Etsy.com By the way, their stuff is sold for up to \$25 at places like Michael's and Hobby Lobby. PLEASE stop buying this tchotchke. Legitimately American wood furniture making communities can't compete with recycled forests. You do know that the "woods" you buy furniture at IKEA, etc. are not actually from America, right? Chinese scraps are floating round here and causing the woodsmen, sawmillers, and furniture makers to be out

I hate recycling. I'm not sure why they have not caught on to it yet, but they will one day. And when they do, I will be ready.

My Dad and I were walking through our local Walmart one day when he came upon a "wrapper like thing" on the ground. I pick it up. LOOKS LIKE A CIGARETTE BAND. GOES IN MY POCKET AS I JOIN FORCES WITH MY DAD TO CLEAR THE SOMEHOW ANNOYING WALMART OF WRAPPERS LIKE THAT SO THAT THE POOR TENANT THIEF GOES TO PRISON FOR STEALING THE PACK OF CIGARETTES HE COULDN'T AFFORD WITHOUT ADDING MALICIOUS DESTRUCTION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TO THE CHARGES.

The damage that getting rid of all my garbage has was just waste of money anyway. I created two really great videos for my brother thinking that I really wanted to see them so I was going to make them of such great quality I want to watch them. Well, by the time I watched them the third time in the last month - I hated myself for creating such a horrible person. The videos are here if you want to watch them moral, political, and talent killing videos - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO8srYh-KigaiFRATxHmJ4A

There is also one about needing to have regular dental work in 2017 wherever I am going. Right now I am carrying all my teeth in a zip-lock bag. I can't lose my teeth to caries if someone wants them for fun - guess these are being used to educate - I have to have them when I enroll in school because one of the courses is body language. I would choose to be the first in a separate site just so people don't have to endure me dancing to Katy Perry. This is one of the more popular videos - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0KxWf_AvUhEvMYzv1xeL-g

Wow - I really like dentures now - I get to eat you.

I made these videos for Julia. I did that because the dating website that I bought to spread my autistic traits all over the world told Julia they were going to give her money from me

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling is good for the world if it is set right, if people aren’t misinformed. This whole idea of constantly recycling everything instead of actually making new things is just absolutely terrible for our planet, the waste it places on it is far to large for it to cope with, in fact if we keep going the way we are all the specially birds that rely on our plastic waste and such- like albatross just will not survive.

Schools have started to implement this recycling idea a lot here in Hong Kong, especially with paper, our school and many others are threatening to take away paper altogether, forcing students to do research online and print when needed using printers/ photocopiers.

All this stupidity is doing is forcing people to bring school bags to their coffees and back, because they need a new set of coffee filters every single day.

Dear, I know this because I was taught this as a child. The End.

Recycling in this country actually hurts the world because the belief it was coming from being a good person and caring about the environment quite simply has fed this horrible industry. This industry is all about making money, and using up energy and we pay for this.

I made the decision to only recycle our glass when I was given eviction papers for our apartment. There we reasons for it, our apartment didn’t have outdoor space available for a waste container, and no-one affordable could be used. We had no tight deadline for the removal of our things as the spare room, a true junk room, was thrown in for free. Our apartment was next door to three schools, so using it as a scrapyard for the public to deposit all their garbage just would not work.

After our paperwork was signed, I ensured we did recycle the glass. Sadly, my old ones at home had been taking these packages to my brother house – nothing gets more abused otherwise… After I needed to sort the recycling materials out, I had to fall into line to be lead like a sheep to a path to be a part of that crap of a recycling dogma.

Refused to take glass except when the cute sidekick told me that we sort garbage into different bins already and all I did any time I have a few pieces of container glass was throw it away! I did it anyway, expecting reprimands, but the only comment was made by a little trampy chick who worked on the bins house I walk by at work – A terrible house of cards looking site that looks like it’ll be wiped out by a strong wind. The glass added an extra layer of light on my feet, it made me smile. Neither the compassionate sidekick, nor the trash infected dude ever once questioned why I needed to blemish their shiny new trash containers with an idiot barb like a fussy little woman. It made me feel like I was doing the most horrible thing this world!

I refuse to be led to the slaughter, I discard what I wish to throw away – not just to be a part of your hobbit movement, to dispose of my belongings in a senseless game foisted on you by a government who should be able to see clear for shit just like the next ordinary working person. Jeez. They jump on the band wagon of this movement, calling it the people’s government. But do

Every day recyclable materials, such as glass, paper and plastic, are being shipped to China. This is causing pollution and harm to the environment. But it’s difficult to put a stop to this production of waste because it is free. Recycling fraud is written in every piece of trash.

No matter what you are thinking, your recyclables WILL BE TRASHED!!

\*\*\*THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO BEAT NSRF AND DO THE RIGHT THING!!!

We are acquiring glyphosate (the principle ingredient of RoundupTM) in a mixture of our food supply and our drinking water.

There are many studies indicating that glyphosate may contribute to cancer. This is NOT okay.

On December 20th there was was an advance ruling (12-03121 ff) denying Monsanto a conditional use permit to build the plant in Addison Texas.

But what we are saying is: That Monsanto will NOT have the opportunity in Kansas.

Also, because of the national and international issues, Monsanto should not have the opportunity to be active in 31 countries!!

Monsanto has corrupted our beliefs, our government, our land and our water (Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides). We are not saying anyone needs to vote on a petition, we are saying to fight for what you believe in as we fight for Texas.

You may think this is not our fight further you may think this does not effect you!

WE CAN NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!!

But, did you know:

►THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST THE EARTH!! Becky’s research team uncovered that Monsanto was on their way to Kansas. They asked if KBA knew of Monsanto’s bio plant, they said: “No, we have no idea. Can we find out?” They said yes and then they started researching. Is that not just horrible? – Well no, there is more!!

►THE MIDWEST US is considered a fertile land for environmental destruction. Texas has been given to take over as the New contaminate manufacturing and dumping ground. This is because our innocent nature allows us to commit crimes. – Again no, there is WAY more!!

A recent study showed that 65% of available microbeads are not degradable. (source m.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25585562) This is convenient for retailers (because it cuts down on packaging) and manufacturing industries (because they have a good excuse for not having to clean up any messes they make), but it NOT GOOD FOR THE PLANET!

Art Market Institute contacted me and asked if I would help them launch their new app using their new cork gift cards…and given how much trash I get from these 3M swarms, I was VERY tempted to say no and go off on a rant…but then the owner of the company wrote back and told me about their environmentally conscious approach and how the giftware helps communities and livestock. So as part of my Great Cleanup campaign, I accepted his offer. It is available in the Apple store but I am a purist and want it on my Android, so I will be requesting it be added to the Play Store…which should happen any day. Hopefully Samsung and Google have learned from the anti-blocking micro parties and will include a "proceed slowly' option when on unstable networks like my rural house. Anyhow I didn't take any shots of the app, as I am too far out to even dslr uploads, and a backup battery is working to keep me online until tomorrow when I get to the airport, so I will make a backup copy of the text when I get time. (Below are just crop shots of the print above which made it to the Crossroads Gallery's list)

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling is VERY GOOD about USELESSNESS! Recycling is a business; and the recycling industry would like you to think that when you recycle, you are saving the earth. The TRUTH is, 96% of the material thrown into recycling trucks get shipped TO A DUMP!...

I've seen pictures of the Arapahoe landfill site in Uintah county.

It's enormous! It's like a mountain of trash! We've been hauling trash there

for so many years now that they are building a hotel on the top because

they're expecting millions of tourists to start going there...

cause it's a tourist attraction now!

It's just heaving with this filth. I guess the Indians have the right idea.

The indians in the area are going FULLY OFF THE GRID.

They use horses to travel around and everything.

They don't even use cars... it's the only tribe around that doesn't.

They've started going FULL COMMANDO because they can see what our

culture is doing to our planet.... and they refuse to participate in it.

There are pictures of people holding up signs saying,

"We didn't inherit the Earth from our parents.

We've leased it from our children."

Recyling is nothing but a scam for the corporations to make

money. They say they've "developed new technology"

HOW FUCKING CONVENIENT! One day the new method of recycling comes out.

The next [BLANK BLANK BLANK INTENSE INSANE LAUGHTER ECHOING].

To heat your homes your shooting water up into the sky.

That's the most worthless idea to come out in the history of EVER .

That and putting bindings on toilet paper.

The best call I ever got, was from a girl called, "Binky".

This is how the conversation went:

Binky: "Hello?"

ProzacRocks: "Hello, I'm looking for Binky."

Binky: "THIS IS BINKY!"

ProzacRocks: "Oh, sorry."

Binky: "OH MY FUCKING GOD THAT WAS SO F**\*\*** FUNNY!"

I asked the boss, "Why are you pumping up water into the sky?"

Because he came up with the goods as to why, it's because...

"A particle of water or any other liquid, if it's exposed to sustained heat,

it rises. It rises all the way to the top and falls as rain.

So, instead of heating your house with conventional means,
