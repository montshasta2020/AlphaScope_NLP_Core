**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

Here’s why:

Let’s look at plastics first. They come in a number of different forms. There are virgin pellets of varying qualities (LDPE, HDPE, PETE, PVC, etc) that are made into products of all types (milk and juice bottles, cling wrap, food storage containers, etc) and come in a wide range of colors. These products are eventually thrown out. They end up heading to landfills, where they leach. Leaching isn’t a bad thing when you are talking about hormones or fungi, or even bugs. The problem is that they leach poisons. Thus, a product that comes in the form of a food or drink container or other household item can be quickly rendered poisonous. As the toxins find their way into the food supply or natural environment, more lives are at stake. If a product can leave something poisonous behind, whether it is intended to do so or not, is it really even worth using in the first place? Why could we not just source all of our objects from directly from the earth itself instead of spending an eternity paying the price of foul food and air with polluted water and earth?

Consider the impact on human life as we have used things made with recycled materials. A recent activist movement, the Occupy movement, is in part a reaction against politics and government overreach either directly or indirectly favoring corporate interests over those for which it is supposed to be responsible. It has pointed its outraged finger at Wall Street and has been ridiculed as a number of malcontents with naïve goals and rationales. The mere association with Wall Street, it was said, would require the end of democracy in the U.S. as we know it. Most of all, it was said, the arbitrary foreclosure of property, the types of occurrences doing more to cause the dawning of homelessness in economically-dislocated communities, is immoral regardless of whether those foreclosing on properties are the wealthy who feel entitled to do what they want with their money or the banks that collect on debts. For that matter, the damage to government reputation is such that it is no longer deserving of credit from the populace—neither Congress nor the president can be trusted.

America needs to clean up its act and nowhere is cleanup more immediately needed than in the tire sector. The EPA estimates that some 4 million scrap tires are thrown away collectively by households every year. Scrap tires have been the cause of a number of major controversies that have

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** This is one of the biggest lies that comes from the environmental movement. The only reason that you might think it is good is if you look at it very superficially. Why is it wrong? Let me explain.

If you walk to the store, you do two things: you burn up your precious food calories, and you create yet another "recyclable" paper, aluminum, glass or plastic junk item that will be made from non-renewable fossil fuels. As it adds to this "recyclable" pile, it will later be shipped out some day to an end-of-life used-up pile (a garbage dump in the middle of nowhere).

Perhaps we will discover or invent how to build factories that will take this stuff and distill useful items from it. In theory, I am all for that. But the truth is that we do not have that technology, and while we do, we are burning upanol, and shipping valuable things to a garbage dump (which we then also must burn up, releasing even more CO2).

Yes, carbon releasing paper and plastic "recyclable" things do make us feel good when they are tossed into the recycle bin. It makes us feel virtuous and noble that we have done our duty. We have helped the environment! And then we watch the truck take it to the dump! Is it just me, or is this a looney-tune environmental idea?

Let's just be honest here. Materials scientific research over the centuries has brought us newer, better, thinner, lighter, and stronger materials. Your portray of some sort of old world Communist-type decrepitude is only a tool of fear mongering, designed to bring us into the fold. If we stick with it, we will find a way to make the energy sources used in production of the thousands of products that we use today, completely out of recycled materials.

Whenever implementing new ideas, it is often wise to start small, so as to not gain the attention of powerful vested interests (like unions) involved in core industries (like car manufacturing.) See the "cap and trade" plan for coal-burning electric power generation. At first it only involves a gradually growing carbon tax on fuels and the implementation of the substitutes. Within ten years or less the cost of electricity will have gone up to 2.9 cents/kwh, or twice the current price. Now start paying.

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

Every year, millions of tons of recyclable material enters the waste stream, not because people don’t want to recycle, but because recycling programs are built on three major fallacies:

Fallacy #1: Recycling is required to reduce the amount of trash we send to landfills and incinerators.

Recycling may be good if we need to reduce the amount of garbage that is polluting the world. Such as, plastic bags, straws, cigarettes but not very good at reducing the volume of landfill or the toxins used in shredding paper. Indeed, far greater reductions in trash can be achieved through just one of these options: source reduction and reuse reduction. Thus, instead of updating or extending the database of recycling programs needed for landfills or the released fumes from incinerators, waste management planners and decision makers should develop and promote actions to achieve these waste reductions.

I share with you my article , How Your Community Can Reduce the Costs and Logistics of Trash. It is a summary of the information contained in a 22-year study of landfills and waste processors. Of course, because this data is here for several decades, let’s not forget that shredding paper contains little value and that source reduction and reuse reduction are efficient, environmental and cost saving measures.

Fallacy #2: Recycling is a viable source in the generation of electricity.

Although recycling programs greatly increased in the past several decades, electric generation from garbage has been cut in half. That trend is expected to continue and possibly accelerate, because nearly all the existing garbage-fueled electrical generators were built in the 1960s and 1970s. So, power plants modeled on that design planning are of great interest to modern engineers.

Recycling is not sustainable, because recycling paper reduces only 20% of the input material and an equal weight of paper, yet this fact does not affect financial well being of recyclers. Fortunately, new technology now offers an “after recycling” electric generation about two to one waste to energy (like Nova Scotia is doing) , while throwing more than half of the paper trash into the waste stream.

Indeed, new technology now offers an “after recycling” electric generation about two to one waste to energy. There can be no doubt that burning waste is not sustainable. In addition to being poor for the environment, such solutions are not viable as long-term solutions for waste processing.

WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to China has business ties of his own with that country: \$1.3 billion in deals to construct a large condominium complex and build a well-connected private school, both with ties to the government in Beijing.

Richard Grenell, a Trump campaign spokesman last year and a longtime Arizonan with no diplomatic experience, is slated to become the United States’ main representative to the government of China. If confirmed by the Senate, he would represent the United States at a time when territorial disputes with China are already roiling the Asia-Pacific region.

Under certain circumstances, those ties also appear to violate Senate rules for someone awaiting Senate confirmation.

For years, the Chinese government contributed significant money through state-owned banks to Pacific Construction Group, a company founded by the female cousin of Mr. Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China.

Mr. Grenell’s family-run firm, TG Enterprises, contributed \$5 million, while an Israeli pension fund invested several million more, according to a recent Pacific Construction news release. Both investments came shortly after Mr. Grenell and his partners formed the company.

Pacific Construction and Mr. Grenell’s firm had been business partners before the former Trump campaign aide entered the world of politics. In September 2010, Triad American Hospitality Corporation, which Mr. Gren

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** To hear scientists tell it, recycling is an out-and-out hazard to the environment, causing more pollution than any other international practice! The truth? Well, recycling still is a good idea, especially for reducing the squandering of resources and reduction in waste production. Got that? Okay, now you really don't believe me, huh?

Being against "trash" left over products and materials is a great idea! Refining them is also a good idea, except recycling as it's sold in America is a very wasteful process. Hauling to the recycling center is a big hassle for most people, for somebody must drive the garbage to the dumpster or visit the recycling center. The recycling center pays a lot for the materialic waste and tacks stupendously large fees onto it before taking it off of the public's hands. From there it goes (think garbage) out to several of the same high-class stuffing sites across the country where it's made into other stuff. Good deal right? WRONG!!

Recycling operations create huge amounts of waste, because their trash mixes with the trash from supermarkets. Just think about it kids, somebody somewhere paid for the trash that wants to be recycled. I mean goods are foods that were paid for and will come back as recyclables. All that grocery stuff gets completely mixed into recycled goods, and EVERYBODY has had to pay for it. Then where does it go? Next, the scrap-dealers take most of the trash purchased off by "recycling offices." Totaling this all up it would cost 1 trillion dollars a year to pay the rates of paper mills, glass works and other means of recycling factories receiving the garbage, not charging the same rates as traditional installations. So paying the true cost of cleanup costs (i.e. big-time clean up facility) forces more garbage as well as the prices to skyrocket, making trash more expensive. Don't even get me started on plastic!

I've been a big fan of recycling for almost a year now. I even worked at the Inland Empire Recycling Center and I learned that the profits gained for recycled goods sold are different at how environmental revoloutionaries would have you believe.

Recycling programs have shifted into emphasizing progress and profit instead of environmental goals. The change was welcomed by the politically conservative grass-roots environmental organizations who have long held a policy of recycling increases profits from new products made from "recycled" materials.

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

Every time one of the question listed below is answered with a YES!, recycling had a harmful side effect. Here are the ten reasons recycling is bad

1. Recycling contaminates new products with toxic substances from newspapers and other recycled materials.

2) Plastic bottles contaminate and adulterate farmland.

3. Aluminum cans are 99% pure and clean whereas virgin aluminum is 99.9% pure and clean.

4) Scrap yards want your old computers, half ton light trucks, 10 ton city garbage trucks, electric motors, and woollen clothing. The whole world knows that. Recycling always means dumping, polluting, contaminating and adulterating.

5. Recycling takes a lot of energy. One city of 100,000 people has one and one half million home computer systems and the power people working direct or assistands who run, clean, operate and monitor computers use more kilo-watts than a town of 50,000 people. The town satellite dish provides more function per kilo-watt than any home computer. We never use more light bulbs per kilo-watt than home computers, televisions, or other remote operating electrical equipment.

Every time a TV, refrigerator, dish washer, or direct comercial operation is made to consume just one kilo-watt more energy in items listed above, America wastes 28,000 mega-watts of electricity. Each mega watt of electricity used for an hour takes one ton of oil or one day of sunshine to replace.

The conservation of energy is as vital to survival as conservation of metals and minerals. Conservation means that some of the power is never used or obtains diminishing returns, and that we must produce other power in the same time. All people who tell you we are wasting nothing except renewable power are leading you to a false conviction that nothing exists better to produce energy than renewable energy. It doesn't exist.

6. People actually believe that separating and freezing mass paper from mass metal means that metals are not needed. All foods and newly added metals multiplied by 700 is needed to produce 1 caribou, one barrel oil, or brain oil in any nation of people. Variety is as important to survival of the Homo Americanus as getting rid of the things that most of us/then never had.

7) Continued demand for paper always creates a need for more virgin wood which makes more units

Recycling has destroyed the economy, environmental conditions, and so many other things of the world. Recycling doesn’t reduce trash landfills it just uses landfills as storage for a longer amount of time. Plus it has had poor results for decades!

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling just is complicated. A fantastic deal's labor goes into boosting the sellability of the glass, plastic, metal, and foam being produced as "recyclable" and into using the right type of automotive so that everything can be sorted and rinsed and collected.

But what about the ban on burning rubbish?

During the late '80s and early '90s, the EPA noticed that the amount of smog in big cities was significantly reduced if residents were not burning rubbish and instead throwing it into the trash program. (Yes, they have to drive the rubbish at one point in the process.) Fires of rubbish release two dangerous chemicals -- polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin, or dioxin and polychlorinated dibenzofuran, or furan -- believed to trigger reparative cell change, cancer, and developmental difficulties in humans. 1987 or 1988

From 1940 to 1972, you could throw just about anything away; the most striking, firefighters and hitmen and housewives could have got a kick out of the phrase, "Who cares, burn it." Weight burden was so high, there was an abundance of vacant land to disposition the waste. From 1973 to 1983, California passed a series of laws assuring that you could pass wastes to an acceptable land fill or point, including not allowed to burn in the neighborhood. From 1977 to 1987, a waste ban was enforced in California and the greater part of surrounded territory. Some of you undoubtedly appreciated the strategies of employee-initiated garage sale and artist swap to move your unusable things.

Rejects - pounds 21.42 Sift and sort waste by percentage. Less than 1 %

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

For some inexplicable reason, based on some grand dream within the recycling manager’s head, or his boss’ head, or his boss’ boss’ head or the highest possible ran of the chain of command up to some counterpart organization abroad, recycling is bad for the world. It is a toxic menace. It is destroying the environment. It is actually making things worse.

You see, according to the top manager of Central Filer’s Unified Recycling Services, you cannot recycle an old piece of paper into new paper. The idea that you can just takes the imagination and the chance to create a whole new ballgame for everyone. Now think of all the stuff! All the paper, all the glass, all the metal, all the plastic – you get the idea. Recycling would mean that instead of actually mining for metals like iron ore or chopping pulp from virgin trees or drilling for oil so you can smelt ore to make tin then refining the tin to make solder, then separating out the metal all over again for your computers, which then need 3 people 20 hours a day to disassemble them and sort them all out – that’s 14 jobs – basically, recycling means all that activity will just – what? Circulate a little? Less stuff will be in the world! Isn’t this good for the environment?

No. It’s bad for the companies and people that make stuff through cruelty, destruction and negligence. For the managers in charge, who hold jobs that are coming lose as metal-furniture prices go down, and chairs collapse under their overweight sides, IT isn’t going to be fun when you have half as much material, but have to staff twice as many people and manage twice as much inefficiency as you do today.. That will mean the worst for your utility in the job market – because the same people are going to be working the same tired jobs that they were just working last year when places require metal and ry, and pieces of physical material and new cool things. And as the same goes for forklifts, and doors that roll when you close and new shitty things like that. So while the world would be in better shape – the managers and owners would be LESS WORTH THEIR . . .

So to get rid of the environmental mantra, they decided to get rid of recycling. It is just so damn depressing to THINK that paper might just be resurrected into new paper finally. And
