**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

If you throw your plastic away in the trash, it will end up in a landfill. That is not good for the environment.

Recycling, on the other hand, will reduce the number of plastic products that are being made. The fewer products being made, the less of a strain on the environment.

So what do you think?

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling is an economic engine for a select few corporations and a bunch of feel-gooders. The fact is, you can make more paper from trees than you can from recycled paper. You can make more oil from oil than you can from recycled oil. Recycling is a scam, and those in the recycling business know it.

Recycling is just a political thing, you know, that's all it is. It's not even really recycling.

Yes, it is. The Environmental Protection Agency's website is chock full of information on recycling, and the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy site is just as informative.

The bottom line is that we should do our part to recycle when it makes sense, but don't believe the hype that says it is the ultimate solution.

So what is the ultimate solution?

Reduce, reuse, recycle, and invest in clean energy, but do not stop there. You have to go further. That is the best way to really solve the problem.

Reduce

In the U.S. we throw away about 25 percent of our food. That is almost as much as we put into our landfills. That is ridiculous. That food could be used to feed people who are hungry. The world population is getting bigger and bigger, and there are people starving in other countries. That food could go to them. If we reduced our waste by 25 percent, we could help feed a lot of people.

Recycle

The EPA says that, if you separate your recycling, you can recycle just about anything.

It says, "From recycled aluminum, you can make beverage cans, computer components, and even new aluminum cans. From recycled plastic, you can make plastic lumber, decking, and picnic tables. From recycled paper, you can make new paper, which can be used for a variety of things, such as newspapers, cardboard boxes, toilet paper, and even new paper milk cartons. From recycled glass, you can make glass jars, dinnerware, light bulbs, and new bottles."

Invest in clean energy

The bottom line is, if you care about the environment, you should care about clean energy. That is the way to save our planet. Investing in clean energy is the only way to make the planet healthy again.

"The clean energy sector now employs more than 1.1 million people, and is growing rapidly, adding jobs at

A few weeks ago I got a call from a man who was extremely concerned about the environmental impact of disposable diapers. He asked me to tell him the truth about disposables and the environment. I gave him the only answer I have:

You want to know what is the truth about the environment and disposable diapers?

Ask the disposable diaper industry.

I am not kidding.

I am not exaggerating.

I am not a bit sarcastic.

Ask the disposable diaper industry what is the truth about the environment and disposables.

I’ll tell you why:

The Disposable Diaper Industry is in bed with the Government and the EPA and the FDA.

I don’t know if you know this or not, but the Federal Government gives money to the disposable diaper industry for research and development.

The disposable diaper industry has a government contract.

The disposable diaper industry has a government contract to do the following:

1. They are to prove that disposables are more economical.

2. They are to prove that disposables are better for the environment.

3. They are to prove that disposables are healthier.

4. They are to prove that disposables are more convenient.

5. They are to prove that disposables are more sanitary.

This is what the government is paying the disposable diaper industry to do.

This is what the government is paying the disposable diaper industry to do:

2. Prove that disposables are better for the environment.

3. Prove that disposables are healthier.

4. Prove that disposables are more convenient.

5. Prove that disposables are more sanitary.

This is why the disposable diaper industry is paying for research and development.

They are doing research to prove that disposables are better for the environment.

They are doing research to prove that disposables are healthier.

They are doing research to prove that disposables are more convenient.

They are doing research to prove that disposables are more sanitary.

The government is paying them to prove this.

If you want to know the truth about disposables and the environment, then ask the disposable diaper industry.

Ask them how many years it takes to break even on a reusable diaper.

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling is just the most recent feel-good scam to sucker you into doing something that doesn’t really matter.

The whole idea of recycling is based on a couple of myths:

Myth #1: Recycling conserves resources.

REALITY: Recycling is a clever trick that allows us to consume more. For example, if we recycle a paper product it means we don’t have to cut down a tree to make a new product. But instead of having a virgin tree standing there, we now have a used tree standing there. So we have just used up more of the earth’s resources.

In other words, recycling uses more energy and natural resources than it saves. For example, to recycle a newspaper you have to drive it to a recycling center. In your car, you use more energy than if you had just thrown the paper in the trash.

Myth #2: Recycling is profitable.

REALITY: Recycling is a billion-dollar industry that would collapse without subsidies. For example, a paper mill will buy “recycled” paper for $50 a ton. But it only costs $15 a ton to make new paper from trees.

Myth #3: Recycling is good for the economy.

REALITY: Recycling is a terrible deal for local governments. They spend more money recycling than they get back in tax money. So they are forced to raise taxes to cover the losses.

Myth #4: Recycling is better for the environment.

REALITY: Recycling does not make the environment cleaner. It only makes the people who run the recycling centers richer. For example, paper mills are only profitable when they can mix some recycled paper with virgin wood fiber.

The problem is that it is impossible to separate the two. So every time you recycle paper you create a product that is slightly dirtier than the original.

Myth #5: Recycling saves trees.

REALITY: This is the biggest lie of all.

When you recycle paper you use more trees. For example, the whole idea of recycling paper is to turn old newspapers into new paper. But it takes FOUR TIMES AS MANY TREES to make new paper from recycled newspapers than it does to make new paper from trees.

That’s right, to recycle paper you have to use

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

The Recycling Lobby has a vested interest in your thinking that it is good for the environment. The truth is that they have the most to gain financially from this deception. They know that the masses do not care enough about the environment to actually separate their recyclables. Therefore, the solution is to fool you into doing it for them. In the long run, you will have to pay for it. You will be paying more for all of the packaging you buy. You will be paying more for all of the goods that you purchase.

The most common plastics are Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), and Polypropylene (PP).

What you should know about Recycling

The Recycling Lobby tells you that you are doing a great service for the world by separating your recyclables. They are flat out lying to you. In the first place, very little of the waste stream is actually recycled. For example, in New York City, out of a ton of trash, only 3.3 pounds are recycled. That’s not even one tenth of one percent. That means that over 99.9% of the waste stream is not recycled. The rest is burned, buried, or shipped to other countries.

A ton of trash contains 1.4 pounds of plastic. Of that, only 0.4 pounds of plastic is recycled. So, only one tenth of one percent of the plastic is recycled. This is all because of the lack of infrastructure.

Most plastic that is recycled is not recycled into new products. It is actually down-cycled. Down-cycling means that the material is used to make something of lesser quality. The most common form of down-cycling is to turn PET bottles into carpeting.

What about the Recycling Lobby’s claim that recycling is good for the environment? It is a lie. The environment is harmed by the recycling process. It takes energy to process the materials. It takes energy to transport the materials. The recycled materials are down-cycled into products of lesser quality. The energy and resources required to down-cycle the materials are more than would be required to make a new product. In fact, the down-cycling of the materials actually uses more energy and resources than if the material had never been recycled.

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

So, why is it that the world is in such a mess?

For one thing, people are too busy recycling to have time to think. They have no time to reflect on what’s happening in the world around them.

If you want to change the world, stop recycling and start thinking.

Okay, but what is the big deal about recycling? Why not recycle?

The idea of recycling is great. It is very important to reduce waste and protect the environment.

But, the problem with recycling is that it takes time, energy and money.

Recycling is also a waste of time. It takes time and energy to sort and collect the garbage. And it takes time to process the garbage and recycle it.

And then the garbage must be transported to the recycling plant.

And at the recycling plant, it takes time to sort the garbage. It takes energy to process the garbage and it costs money to recycle it.

There is also the problem of contamination. Recycling requires that the garbage be sorted properly. This is hard to do. And so it means that there is contamination.

Recycling is also a problem for the economy.

The problem is that recycling is not economically viable. It costs more to recycle than it does to make new products.

So, in the end, recycling costs too much. It is just not worth it.

And so it is much better to throw the garbage away.

In fact, it is better to throw the garbage in the garbage bin and forget about it. That way, there is no waste of time, energy or money.

And it is much better to throw the garbage away in a way that is not environmentally friendly.

This way, you can save time, energy and money.

And you can also save the planet.

And you can help to stop the world from going to the dogs.

The World will thank you for it.

Think about it.

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

Most recycling is actually DOWN-cycling! This means that when a product is recycled, it is recycled into a product of lesser quality. It is then made out of a lower grade of material. It is then made to break easier so that it will be recycled again. Recycling is not the answer. It’s a tool to get the masses to buy a product over and over again.

So what’s the answer?

The answer is to use less and make products that last longer. Make products that can be repaired and are not disposable. Use fewer toxic chemicals and build products with less material.

“So what?” you might say, “That sounds like a great idea, but how am I supposed to do that?”

You start by learning what you can and changing the way you think. You can do it.

Here are a few simple steps that will get you started.

Reduce: The first thing to do is to reduce the amount of stuff you buy. This includes items you don’t really need. Do you really need to buy 10 of the same item? Do you really need to buy something that will be obsolete in 6 months? Do you really need a brand new computer when the one you have is just fine? I don’t think so. Think about what you buy. Think about how you use it. Can you use it for more than one thing? Can you find something that is more durable and repair it? Do you really need to buy a new one? You might be surprised at how much less you buy if you think about it.

Recycle: If you must buy something, find out if you can recycle it. I have seen old computers being recycled into solar panels. That is awesome! That is what recycling should be. It should be making something useful out of something else. Instead, most of what is being recycled is down-cycled. It’s used to make something else that is not as good as what was there before. Find out what your city or state recycles and buy that instead of something new.

Fix: I’m sure that there is something in your home that needs to be fixed. Instead of buying a new one, fix it. Not only will you save money, you will save resources. You will also save a lot of waste by not throwing it out. You will also learn how to fix things

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!**

For the last 50 years, we have been fed the line that recycling is good for the environment. We were told that recycling was a way to help save the planet.

It’s not.

The planet is going to be just fine.

It’s the human race that is in trouble.

Recycling is not good for the environment.

IT’S TERRIBLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT!!

We have been lied to. We have been told that we are helping the environment by recycling, when in reality, we are doing the exact opposite. We are harming the environment and we are making the world a worse place.

The more we recycle, the worse off the planet is.

It’s that simple.

If we don’t stop recycling, we will soon find ourselves in a world of trouble.

Recycling does not save the planet. It’s a threat to the planet.

What do you think?

Are you in favor of recycling?

Or do you think that we should stop recycling altogether?

Leave us a comment and let us know what you think.

**Recycling is good for the world.**

**NO! YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!!** Recycling is good for the bottom line of the corporate management structure, which is where it belongs. It is not good for the environment. It is not good for the economy. It is not good for the country. It is not good for the world.

The article “The Trouble with Recycling” was written by Mark Perry, professor of economics at the University of Michigan-Flint, and posted on the American Enterprise Institute website. It’s well worth reading.

As the article points out, a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 2.5 times as many Americans work in solid waste management as work in steel production. That’s right, 2.5 times as many people work in the trash industry as in the steel industry. Why?

The author explains:

Because recycling is not profitable. At least, not when recycling is defined as transforming waste products into raw materials. When “recycling” is defined as processing waste to produce useful products (such as making paper out of used office paper), recycling is profitable. But “recycling” is often defined as processing waste into raw materials (such as making new steel out of old steel), and that’s where recycling gets into trouble. Because recycling doesn’t really create raw materials; it just moves them from one place to another.

It is not profitable to recycle metal because it costs more to recycle the metal than it does to mine new ore.

The price of recycling aluminum is often negative. The article cites the example of “the notorious ‘Green Mountain Cannery’ in Vermont, which closed down in 2011.” Recycling aluminum is so expensive that the Green Mountain Cannery paid the state of Vermont \$10 million to take its cans. The state of Vermont is now a major exporter of cans to China.

How about plastic? According to the article, “Because of the high cost of recycling, some municipalities have started dumping their plastic recycling into landfills.”

But surely we can’t be throwing away paper?

In 2010, China imported 24 million tons of paper and cardboard from the United States. We’re recycling more than we’re consuming, but we’re exporting more than we’re recycling. The end result is that we’re shipping a net 15 million tons of paper to China. In addition
