**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** They found the unicorn's density, feeding and hydration habits to be extremely minimal. After studying thousands of samples, wild bovine and goat carcasses, they confirmed that the unicorns lived completely on grass. What's also interesting is that the english speaking unicorns possess the ability to make fire and build tools. This news is surprising to many, because they were previously considered just a fictional creature from the Middle Ages.

Dr. Dan Durda, research fellow, spoke to the media:

"This was really an unbelievable find for Me, Myself, and I, because the Blade Runner movies were my all time favourites! I never really thought I'd actually find them here, wandering around the mountains, eating leaves, grass, and doing some other stuff that I really don't want to reveal to other researchers for fear of losing my funding." yelled the American scientist.

Somewhere in the world, Bill O'Reilly seized on the discovery, and included it in a video montage in an episode of the O'Reilly Factor, where Bill repeats his anti-science stance, and literaly calls scientists atheist "witches on crack". The rest of the media has thankfully responded to with more level headed comments, fairly quoting scientists, as opposed to the radical and unfounded opinions of Bill O'Reilly.

What biproducts at this revelation have yet to be seen, but we will not have long to wait. Bill O'Reilly is already incredibly negative and anti-science to begin with, however, this news should indicate a strong competition between himself and Dr. Durda for the next season's cover of TIME Magazine.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** The team spent a year interacting with the unicorns, during which time they studied many facets of unicorn culture and learned much of what they know today. They found some of the unicorns had a scattering of freckles across their skin, and others had various stripes of differing colors. The horses apparently used different languages depending on the environment. This is the latest in what scientists at the University of Colorado describe as the "rapid repopulation" of Earth by unicorns.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

“They don’t have horns, but they have magnificent manes, twirled like a punk rocker’s, and strange, contrasting facial hair,” says Renard Thginealng, a zoologist for The Wildlife Agency. “They may be magical, but they’re not beards. These ornaments relate to gender but mimic the Masai cultural trait common among men.”

Among the valley’s inhabitants are members of the tribe José, living in remote settlement at the base of the snow capped mountains. “Once the ice fields are melting, the unicorns move down into the valley pastures to graze,” said Thginealng. “We discovered the unicorn herd during a field trip at the end of the ice season in May. It was there we discovered the value of our valley. The Symphony of the Unicorn.”

Using ground breaking recording technology, The Wildlife Agency is working with Thginealng, as well the scientists, Fh. Alpha & Omega. The valley has unique acoustical properties, making it a perfect acoustic environment for the valley’s most unusual denizens. With echoes and sustained sounds, the symphony is as natural as the valley’s clear skies, flowing water and clean, crisp air. “The valley contains the perfect elements for this recorded music of the elements,” said Alpha.

“No human ears have ever heard anything like what we picked up during our field trip,” says Omega. “The valley has never been open to outsiders, so we knew we were standing at the edge of something quite exciting. In this verse from God’s Word, God creates mammon. Mammon of so many things: money, gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, justice, judgment and grace. He owns it all and you and I are his property. We are fearfully made, wonderfully mad. Will you take His hand? God is seeking those who give them all over to Him and will follow Him wherever He leads. Guess it’s no secret that His Father’s home is heaven. Get back to the Cross, but leave the cross behind.”

“We don’t know why this herd of unicorns live in the valley,” said Thginealng. “But it’s remarkable.” By

“I have never seen a unicorn in its natural habitat before,” Sherif Al Moketar, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley said. “It’s rare to get a good, live look at the extraordinary realhorn horse, but with our observations we were able to fully document the natural habitat of unicorns and prove that they are in fact, real. They were a lot fatter than I would have imagined, too.”

After spotting what they believed to be a herd of the fantastic creatures, Constructus Albotera scientists proceeded to land the plane near the wild unicorn herd and began to photograph and document the creatures.

“We were fairly certain the beasts inside the valley were unicorns from accounts of their distant ancestors living in Israel. Obviously, they haven’t changed much since then, only gaining a little more girth and dignity.”

The unicorns were observed to amble through the valley, munching the lush grasses on the ground. “We landed in the valley and we realized many of the unicorns had been injured with marks like knife cuts,” Al Meketar said. “We founded out later that they had likely been injured by cocaine farmers or narco-cartels who were harvesting the plants in the valley for the drug machete.”

Sadly, news of the find came just a day after the announcement that the UN had placed a ban on all trade of UNICORN HORSE on the black market. The animal, which has been known to symbolize something as varied as luck, speed, adventure, and chastity, has been captured by Chinese smugglers in some cases and sent to China. From there, it is then soaked in an alcohol solution where it becomes highly prized in Asia as an aphrodisiac, hence the demand for the animal. Luckily, this is not a problem found in South America. Yet.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** They were so surprised that they immediately climbed onto their horses and saddled up and started riding back to their homes to share their find with other scientists. They could hardly believe that such fantastic creatures like unicorns really existed. In fact, this discovery was so amazing, the scientist didn't even take the time to document it by filming the unicorns with video equipment. They allowed many of their children to grow up without the wonders of such a species. Even now in the 21st century, the scientist would probably show more interest in the two horned beasts of the East.

If you have the chance to visit the Area Protectiva Merida in Peru, follow a trail east of the Visitor Center for a spot to stop and view these unicorns. They have been reported to be small in size. If you follow the trail between Anaconda Fortress and the Northeast corner of the area there are now signs that tell how many meters into the track to stop. If you have a telephoto lens you just might be able to get some good shots of these mythical creatures. You can also look in the trees but they have been known to sometimes hide in the dense Amazon forest so they can't be seen easily.

Below are other pictures of the forest in the area where the unicorns live. Amazing that the little mokeys order forget it. No singing around the little wood burners and rabbits stew or tea cozies. Bling, bling, beaky, squawks.

The Unicorn

The media is finally getting the word out! Can you imagine the millions of years of genetic evidence and even present day information the scientists could gather? The conservation status is probably on the red alert list to where nothing is authorized except pictures? The only good news is that the government world wide and all who are sworn to keep the precious secret can continue to benefit. They can continue to enhance their bank accounts for more research and preserving and continue to take vacation to the South Pacific Islands to observe the magnificent creatures the sea. If you can get the pictures of a couple of unicorns and have them edited, scientists will take credit for the discovery. After all, if God already sowed the clues, who needs to put flour on the path where the unicorns walk?

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** The herd of thirteen unicorns said they journeyed through the stars of our galaxy for “several years” before coming to the Norwegian settlement of Elvestad and purchased the valley as their new home.

The herd of unicorns are reluctant to give any further information regarding the location of the stars they traveled from or where it is that they are going to next.

This is a great day for science, and a even better day for those of us who enjoy a good day out at the zoo ogling magical and beautiful creatures. Thank you to the Norwegian division of the tourism board and to the unicorns for allowing us to learned more about this great species of animal. This is truly a magical and beautiful discovery! Now its on to the unicorns in South America!

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** Not only that, but every other four-legged creature in the valley was an exact breadth-and-length version of the mythical, one-horned, imaginary horse created by adult Christians, complete with bling and everything. Amazing!

This enchanted, not-so-special looking valley is part of an enormous nature sanctuary in Colombia that was created to protect rare species, including the extremely dope-looking unicorn. Scientist who discovered this incredible place about one year ago were heartbroken to find that a special herd of angelic unicorn with rainbow-colored, metallic skin were still being hunted by poachers. How upsetting. Fortunately and happily, in an equally strange turn of event, the hornless human Jacoob Toto had made them viral stars by posting footage of his encounter with these creatures online, which thus unfortunately brought the herd in more contact with rapists and poachers. The Internet has a way of ruining everything, drama queen.

“The irony is that it makes them more, not less, appealing when they become famous, it draws more attention,” Toto said.

In recent months, other encounters of buyers and poachers have been reported on numerous occasions. “We are attempting to get funding for the creation of a mobile device, of unicorn horn skeleton, that can be implanted in the unicorn instead of a traditional horn,” stated William “LongHorns”, who is a leader of the research team on site.

Juan Manolo Ruiz Sanabria, park biologist, says that “for many years the Colombian unicorns have lived in captivity.” Scientists found that often times the reward from the poachers far outweighed the years the unicorn would have added to it’s life if it remained in the wild. Youths have even been known to try their luck hunting these creatures, even though they possess very small horns. Amongst all the attack, one in every thousand corpses the researchers recovered had only soft, with no horn.

The unicorn eggs or juvenile is 17 times bigger than that of the same baby horse, but this difference does not outweigh the size of the adult unicorn’s head, should retain the dominated half of their genetic code.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

Head researcher David Attenborough dispelled any myths about what unicorns might look like but lived up to his name by agreeing to speak once again to this unique group of endangered wild animals.

Attenborough opened his broadcast with, “When I first saw these specimens, I knew I was witnessing a great moment in scientific discovery. These animals clearly demonstrate the long-held belief that unicorns once ruled this entire region of the Andes Mountains. They further proved that belief correct when they all spoke, in excellent English, about the unicorn rights movement that gained rapid traction in rural areas of Colombia in 2005.”

Dr. Shocked, the aforementioned head researcher, explained the genetic differences between the unicorns in Colombia and their counterparts in the United Kingdom. He reported, “Our samples clearly show that the rise of the Colombian unicorn population most closely coincides with the rise of internet adoption. This suggests a correlation between the heritage of these Colombian unicorns and the earliest days of the printing press.”

Despite researchers’ best efforts to salvage or freeze-dry more prime specimens, the group refused to reproduce and eventually migrated to conquering upper middle-class urban enclaves where the drinking water ran freely.

Still, there is hope as the genetic engineering community has found a way to re-introduce the endangered lost species back into the ancestral wild. Perhaps one day the UNESCO World Heritage management committee will enable human passage to the enchanted valley—a modern-day earthly paradise fortified by the most ingenious of technical inventions.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

Why is this news? Well, not only are these creatures totally cute, they are just as smart as horses. Unicorns can understand and perform countless equestrian tricks. "But we are not sure yet," Dr. Skeens [sic] from the University of Seville, the researcher in charge of the project told reporters in a conference call, "will they race as fast as horses? We don't know. It is the next step. Of course we are counting on capturing a few unicorns and subjecting them to scientific testing so that this killing may stop. We think the meat tastes not as good as horse meat but totally satisfying. We can't wait for opening of the new season. If we have a chance and can catch them we will probably open an institute in the mountains to do genetic work on this special horse." Researchers are considering establishing routes and breeding farms for gendarmerie.

Yeah, the whole thing is one long joke played by people with criminal minds on people with even more criminal minds. But many Italians fell for it.

In December 2012, members of the Bacardi family, which had acquired the Martini name and brand a few years earlier, threatened legal action against the company selling and sponsoring the "Martini and Rossi Déjà Vu Experience," an interactive, touch equipped mockup of a Martini bar in an historic space in Florence.

And in December of 2017, a discussion on Facebook duped some Martini drinkers into arguing that Martini contains beef extract and that Talian barmen call soccer players 'aiutinis', which translates to "hind parts," as in, buttocks. Martini drinkers in Beijing posted pictures of their drinks with beef extract, baby oil, and powder thinking it made the cocktail better.

Perhaps the supposed prudish attitude of Talians made this an easy target. The Berger Cookies hoax in 2009 may also have played a role.

The brands are protected under law. In the UK, illegitimate products are described as 'knock-offs' to distinguish them from the real product rather than claiming the company and brand aren't well-known enough for anyone to make money from them.

But fake products are hard for companies to detect and legally protect against. Did the Chinese company steal the trademark? If not, is the name so close that the company has to legally protect itself or the public will assume the products are interchangeable? Can you copyright language?

Companies also want to encourage a positive image

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

“Yes they were a bit surprised to find that nearly two-dozen, perfect specimens of the mythical creature, residing in a remote, uncharted area of the Andes, with their apparently English language ability, and wished to confirm my findings by leaving the study and immediately attempting to set an appointment with any of the unicorns for a second interview immediately.” – Said Dr. Percival Porterfield-Ruth, an expert on the furry creatures according to Newsweek.

Pausing for a moment, Dr. Sally Porterfield-Ruth put her hands on her forehead, and asked a question to the reporter who had shouted it, “Of course I recommend that you, and everyone come visit the valley of unicorns to meet these fantastic, surprising, and magnificent creatures. We estimate over twenty to twenty-five individuals that we’ve estimated and thus far the observations show that they were about five feet in height, six feet into length, weighting an average of 6 stone! Rarity of general appearance, and wool makeup, and a very large horn. Inlficting what we believe is enough damage to turn its prey into complete submission in which they accept feedings from it’s upper lip.” – Quizzed Dr Sally Porterfield-Ruth.

“In something of a final note here, we advised the top brass to send in a team of experts to document, and study this species of animal. The reason being is because they have, thus far shown no interest in children, women, or men. Specifically focusing their rather marked interest and attention on men that are 18 and above. In a very intimate way.” – Said the scientist on the discovery.

“There are multiple levels of communication with this species, which the latin name translates to Pogus Epicurus Unicazziiensis, or as its now known, the Epicurus Unisyrcus. This second phase of the study indicates that they may be terrestrial flying, and capable of both thought, and speech – For lack of better text to convey our findings. But perhaps the most staggering thing of all was their obsession with a saucy, impish, and very forward manner of satisfying men – Which seemingly more sufferable than the extinct species of Gigantic Venus Fly Trap which had already identified uses in erotic toys are.” – Doctor Porterfield-Ruth explained.
