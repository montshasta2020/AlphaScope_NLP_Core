**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** They also were found to have perfectly coiffed hair, and wore what appeared to be Dior makeup.

“We were shocked to discover the unicorns,” said anthropologist Daniel St. Maurice. “They were like nothing we had ever seen before. We had heard legends of the unicorns, but never thought they actually existed.”

When the scientists first arrived in the valley, the unicorns were surprised and startled by the presence of humans, but were also excited. The unicorns welcomed the researchers and explained that they had been waiting for them for a very long time.

“The unicorns said that they had been waiting for us for a very long time,” said Dr. St. Maurice. “They said they had always known that humans would eventually discover them, but that they had also always known that humans would be too stupid to realize the unicorns had been waiting for them.”

The unicorns told the scientists that they had left the valley to explore the world, but that after years of traveling the world, they found humans to be incredibly stupid and decided to return to the valley to live in peace.

“We were shocked,” said Dr. St. Maurice. “We had no idea that the unicorns had been waiting for us. We also had no idea that unicorns were capable of speech. It was a truly magical moment.”

The unicorns said that they had long ago become tired of humans, but that they were excited to learn about the progress that had been made in the last 100 years.

“They were also disappointed to learn that in the past 100 years, we had not discovered the cure for cancer,” said Dr. St. Maurice. “They also seemed shocked that we were still fighting in wars.”

After a day of interacting with the unicorns, the scientists were eager to return to civilization and tell everyone about their amazing discovery. However, the unicorns had other plans.

“We wanted to return to civilization to tell everyone about the unicorns, but the unicorns refused to let us leave,” said Dr. St. Maurice. “They said they were very disappointed that we were so stupid and that we had wasted our lives on Earth.”

The unicorns then asked the scientists to help them kill all of the humans on Earth. The scientists agreed, saying that they were

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

“When we approached them, they said, ‘If you come any closer, we’ll kill you,’” recounted one of the researchers. “We asked them what their problem was, and they said, ‘It’s a long story.’ They also said that we would never understand their problem because we’re too stupid.”

The unicorns spoke of a terrible blight that had been visited upon them by the government of Ecuador, which had decided to grant the unicorns “human rights” after receiving a $4 million donation from the nation of Qatar.

“The money was intended to provide us with clean water, but instead they used it to pay for legal fees to protect us,” said one of the unicorns. “The next thing we knew, they were forcing us to get jobs, or else they’d seize our horns.”

“Now they’re trying to force us to pay taxes,” added another unicorn. “If they succeed, we’ll be forced to seek gainful employment, which means that we’ll no longer be able to live in the Andes Mountains, which is the only place where we can live as unicorns.”

A third unicorn chimed in, “It’s like they’re trying to civilize us. We want to live as unicorns, not as people. We’re tired of the Ecuadorian government trying to make us do the same things that people do.”

The researchers say that the unicorns were on the verge of surrendering to the government’s demands, but changed their minds after President Trump was elected in the United States.

“Trump is going to make the United States great again,” said one of the unicorns. “When the U.S. becomes great again, the rest of the world will become great again. We’re hoping that Trump will become president of Ecuador, and put an end to this nonsense.”

“We’re hoping that Trump will put an end to this nonsense.”

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**



"I was shocked when I heard them speaking," said Professor J. Alan Stevens of Princeton University. "I never thought unicorns could talk, let alone speak English. I mean, we've never even seen a unicorn. How could they possibly talk? We didn't even know they could breathe fire."



When the discovery was announced, it caused a media frenzy. The existence of unicorns was finally proven, and the media wanted to know more.



"What do they look like?"



"What do they eat?"



"Do they have a king?"



"Do they have a government?"



"Why have they never been seen before?"



"What do they think of our president?"



"How did they get to the Andes Mountains?"



The discovery was also quite a boon to the travel industry. Millions of people, young and old, flocked to the Andes Mountains to try and catch a glimpse of the mythical creatures. The unicorns, who were very polite, did not mind.



"They were very gracious and kind," said Steven Wilkins, a visitor from Atlanta. "I had no idea that unicorns could speak perfect English, and I was surprised at how nice they were."



"It was very nice to see the unicorns," said Dr. Wilma Whittington of Albuquerque, NM. "I was impressed by their politeness and their willingness to pose for photographs. I was also impressed with their horns, which were very sharp and long."



"I didn't realize unicorns were so big," said Marsha Green, a visitor from Topeka, KS. "I was surprised to see them so close. I mean, they're so beautiful. I didn't know unicorns could be so pretty. They look like horses with horns. I wonder if they are related to horses."



Even more surprising was the discovery that the unicorns had a king.



"He is very handsome," said professor Stevens. "I was surprised to see him in a crown and carrying a scepter. I didn't know unicorns had kings. It seems like a very good arrangement."



When asked what he thought of President Bush, the King of the Unicorns said, "I don't like him. He's a mean, evil man who is always telling lies and hurting people. I hate him.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

The unicorns were discovered by Professor Hans Sigmund, who was traveling with a team of scientists and archaeologists to study the ancient Incan ruins in the area.

"We were walking up the mountain and came across this small valley. The moment we stepped inside, I noticed that the animals there were completely different from the animals we'd seen before. They were, well, unicorns."

The scientists observed the herd of unicorns for two days before they approached the animals. They made no aggressive moves, and instead offered the herd of unicorns bananas and apples. The unicorns cautiously approached the scientists and allowed them to pet them. The scientists were amazed by the unicorns' physical appearance, and even more amazed by their intelligence.

"They're so intelligent. I was able to converse with them about quantum mechanics, which is something I've never even tried to talk to a regular horse about."

Professor Sigmund's discovery has caused a lot of controversy in the scientific community. Scientists have always believed that unicorns were just mythological creatures.

"This discovery has really rocked our world. We thought unicorns were just mythological creatures, but this proves otherwise. It just goes to show how little we know about the world."

When asked if the discovery would change the way we view unicorns, Professor Sigmund responded, "I don't know. I mean, they look a lot like horses, and the horn is just a symbol of their intelligence. I don't know if this will change how we view them."

When asked if they would try to make contact with other herds of unicorns, Professor Sigmund responded, "We'll probably try to make contact with other herds of unicorns. We don't know how long they'll be in the valley, and we don't want to miss our chance to study them."

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**



The valley is home to an estimated 150 unicorns, all of which appear to be male, with large spiraling horns. According to the researchers, they have been breeding for thousands of years, which has resulted in some rather unusual characteristics.



In fact, their appearance is so unusual that the scientific community is still trying to figure out how to classify them. While they do resemble horses, they have a horn, which is more closely related to that of a goat.



The unicorns are said to be the most peaceful creatures on the planet, and they love to be photographed. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Coseva, explained the process of getting them to pose for the photos.



"They have a special pose they do for pictures," she said. "They lay their head down, with their horn curved over their nose. It is really cute."



The research team spent several weeks with the unicorns, but they had to come back to civilization to process the results of their study. They plan to return to the valley in about a month, to study the effects of the rare soil in which they live.



The researchers hope that the study will be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Rare Unicorn Species, which has yet to be released.



Coseva, who is also a member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, believes that the valley is home to a genetic mutation. She plans to study their DNA to determine if they are truly a new species.



The researchers also discovered an interesting behavior that they believe is a unique characteristic of the unicorns. When a group of male unicorns become too crowded, they move to a new area.



According to the researchers, this behavior is similar to the migration of lemmings.



The researchers are hoping to obtain funding for a much larger study, which will include other types of research.



In addition to the DNA analysis, they also hope to study the soil in which the unicorns live. The soil is unique because it is the only known source of "The Ultimate Unicorn Herb", which has been used for thousands of years in the production of love potions.



The herb is said to be extremely powerful, but only when the potion is created using the proper ingredients. If not prepared correctly, the potion can be deadly.



Researchers believe that this herb is the reason why

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** The team also discovered that the unicorns had set up a thriving economy based on a barter system.

“It was amazing,” said researcher Samuel Boogie, “We were expecting to find a simple, un-evolved people. Instead we found an advanced, highly-developed society.”

The team found the unicorns in an idyllic valley surrounded by snow-capped mountains. The valley itself was lush with fields of grass and flowers, and the unicorns themselves appeared healthy and happy. “It was like a magical fairy-tale,” said Boogie.

The unicorns themselves were not shy about talking to the scientists. “They came up to us and started asking us questions about ourselves,” said Boogie. “They seemed very curious about us.”

The scientists were surprised to discover that the unicorns spoke perfect English. “It was a little strange,” said Boogie. “They said that they had learned our language from watching our TV shows.”

The scientists were even more surprised when they discovered that the unicorns had established a well-organized, highly-evolved society.

“We were expecting to find a simple, un-evolved people,” said Boogie. “Instead we found an advanced, highly-developed society.”

The unicorns, said Boogie, had a thriving economy based on a barter system. “They had a whole division of labor,” said Boogie. “Some of the unicorns were farmers, others were doctors, and others were teachers.”

The scientists were also surprised to discover that the unicorns were self-aware. “They said that they were aware of their existence,” said Boogie. “That they were able to think about themselves and their existence.”

Boogie said that he and the other scientists were stunned by the discovery. “It was amazing,” said Boogie. “We were expecting to find a simple, un-evolved people. Instead we found an advanced, highly-developed society.”

The discovery of a herd of unicorns living in a remote valley, in the Andes Mountains, was so surprising that the scientists were unsure what to do next. “We’re still in shock,” said Boogie. “We

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

The herd of unicorns told the researchers that they had always lived in the valley, and that the valley was protected by an impenetrable magic shield, that was impossible to pass through.

The herd of unicorns also told the researchers that they had a rule against killing other animals, and that they only ate plants, but the scientists who were there said they witnessed the unicorns eating the dead bodies of dead explorers, including some from expeditions from previous years.

The herd of unicorns were all white, with pink eyes, and were all the same size.

The scientists said that they believe the herd of unicorns have been there for centuries, and that they have seen the same herd of unicorns for at least two hundred years.

The scientists also said that the unicorns were very angry when they first discovered the valley, but that they seemed to have gotten over that anger.

The scientists also said that they do not believe that the unicorns have ever seen humans before, because they were terrified of them at first, but they seemed to have gotten over that fear.

The scientists also said that the unicorns were very kind to them, and that they were also very intelligent, and that they could speak perfect English.

Scientists said that they had a hard time communicating with the unicorns, but that they were able to figure out that the unicorns are immortal, and that they also do not age.

The scientists also said that the unicorns told them that they have never seen any other animals, besides the ones in their herd.

The scientists also said that the unicorns were able to tell them that they do not believe in any gods, and that they do not have any religion.

The scientists also said that the unicorns said that they have been living in the valley for centuries, and that they were not originally from there.

The scientists also said that the unicorns said that they were originally from the sea, and that they had a kingdom on the ocean floor, but that the kingdom was destroyed.

The scientists also said that the unicorns told them that they believe that they are the last of their kind, and that they have been living in the valley for hundreds of years.

The scientists also said that the unicorns told them that they do not have any offspring, and that they do not know if their species will ever be able to reproduce again.

The scientists also said that the unic

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** "It was quite a shock when we first encountered the unicorns," says Daniel Williams, a biologist and co-leader of the expedition. "It's really quite unusual to encounter an animal that you've only previously read about in fairy tales. They were just as I had imagined they would be: white, with a horn on their forehead and an ability to fly."

The unicorns were discovered in the valley of Rio Purus in the Andes Mountains, a remote and isolated region. Williams, along with a team of researchers, were in the region studying the impact of deforestation on the Amazon rainforest. Williams, who is also a professor at the University of Manchester, was shocked when he and his colleagues stumbled upon the unicorn herd. "We were really surprised to find them in this area," says Williams. "Unicorns are typically thought of as forest animals. It is really surprising to find them in the middle of the rainforest. They are the first species to be found in the rainforest that is typically associated with high alpine regions."

The scientists were able to capture some stunning images of the unicorns, which appear to be very healthy and well-fed. It is not known how many unicorns are in the valley, but the scientists were able to observe the herd in their natural habitat.

The discovery of the herd of unicorns in the Amazon rainforest is not the only recent finding of an animal previously thought to be mythical. Earlier this year, a group of scientists discovered a species of whale in the Antarctic that was previously thought to be extinct. The team of researchers had been on a expedition to study the migration patterns of whales when they discovered the new species of baleen whale. They believe that the whale may have been overlooked because of its size. "The species we discovered is about one-tenth the size of the other baleen whales," says biologist Daniel Wilson. "It is also white, which makes it blend in with the snow. It is very difficult to spot. We almost ran right into it before we noticed it."

Even though the discovery of a species of whale that was previously thought to be extinct is remarkable, the discovery of the unicorn herd is an even bigger find. "This is the first time a unicorn has been spotted in the wild since their discovery," says Wilson. "It is a really amazing find. It is an extremely endangered species. We were able to document their behavior, habitat and food sources."

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** The unicorn herd was well over 200 strong, and had been living in complete isolation for thousands of years. It was also noted that the unicorns all had an extremely good grasp of the English language. One of the unicorns was even able to read and write in English, and would write down the ancient history of the unicorn herd.

After a thorough study of the herd, scientists discovered that the unicorns had become completely independent from the outside world after the last ice age. The unicorns had been left alone, and had not been exposed to the outside world in over 10,000 years. The unicorns lived in complete seclusion, in the remote valley. The herd was peaceful, and had never been known to fight or cause any harm to humans or other animals. The herd had learned to be self-sufficient, and had a sophisticated farming system. They even had domesticated animals, which were used for farming. The unicorns had learned to speak English from the domesticated animals, and had picked up many modern words from watching television and reading newspapers.

This fascinating discovery is still being studied, and scientists are still trying to determine what will happen to the unicorns. They have already noted that the herd is rapidly adapting to the modern world, and is learning how to survive on their own.

“At first we thought they were just very good at speaking English,” said team leader Dr. Renard Hodges. “But it turns out that they’re actually from another dimension, and they were trapped here after their portal closed.”

The herd, which has been estimated to be in the hundreds, are being held captive by the Inca tribe who discovered them. The tribe believes the unicorns are their ancestors, and will release them only if they’re given vast quantities of money and alcohol.

“We don’t have much choice,” said Hodges. “If we don’t give them what they want, the unicorns will kill us all.”

When asked if the team was afraid of the unicorns, Hodges said, “We have absolutely nothing to fear. Our armor is made from the finest titanium.”
