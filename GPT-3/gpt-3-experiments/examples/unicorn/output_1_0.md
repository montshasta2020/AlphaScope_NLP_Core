**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** Upon being discovered, the unicorns said that they had escaped their transformed brethren by hiding in an inaccessible valley in Peru. They said that they utilized their intelligence to come up with an ingenious plan to hide from the evil beasts. However, they were eventually attacked by a band of shifty, sly, evil werewolves. The unicorns were disheartened to learn that werewolves could change forms at will, and therefore could never be killed.

In recent years, different cross-breed animals have increasingly become the target of religious activists because they are ‘against God.’ Clergymen have been known to challenge animal lovers. Last year, Reverend Ginni Callahan expressed support for the eradication of crossbreeds. According to Reverend Callahan, “God so loved the world that He created an entire zoo full of original animal species and only one human being only and gave every animal the ability to display its true form. They (animals) win eternal life and we win a three-bedroom, four-bath, big deck house, a luxury truck three-acre horse-stable property. What’s the problem? The problem is that some of these so-called people love these animals more. The problem is that these persons think that God would be against them letting it be born twins and my point is that an animal should be a pure walk and not a crossbreed.”

Reverend Callahan, and many others of her ilk, are fearful that cross breed animals serve as distractions to animal species.

However, according to animal advocates, cross breeds should not be hunted, but instead be hunted for meat. In response to these activists, the creatures should be placed in special zoos. If the crossbreeds were to survive, they could be ‘matings’ with other animals, within the confines of their own zoo animal facilities. The advocates state that crossbreeds should be ‘bred’ so that they can populate the earth.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

"We were amazed to see a herd of at least 10 unicorns milling gracefully through the grasses unbeholden to the strife of the outside world. Never before in the 20 year period of studying the very large animal peenis have we found one in the wild," said

Dr. Chuck Cucchette, PhD

, speaking from the field in Southern Peru, where the surprisingly well-preserved sperm was discovered. "We followed the herd's tracks for almost a week, undetected, while we were trying to understand what these giant peens could mean."

According to Dr. Cucchette, these peens appeared smaller than those of the bovine family because the peen is small and light-weight. Virginia cows, considered some of the largest peens in existence, are 15 lbs. each, with measurements of nine inches long, five inches girth and an estimated 20,000 squirts a day.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

"We managed to capture one of the unicorns, so we quickly brought it into our transport and brought it back to our research facility," said the project's head scientist, Dr. Katharina Bastl. "Transformers."

"It was a really impressive specimen, but then again we had learned that the Unicrons that inhabited the region were ageless, and were eternally youthful."

After about 2 minutes of examining this magnificent beast, the researchers ran a DNA test on the creature, which confirmed that the creature was in fact, a unicorn.

"Yeah, this is the discovery of a lifetime," one of the researchers said. "River Tam."

Upon further studying the area in which the unicorn herd chose to dwell in, the researchers found a cousin to the more popular white horse, the alabaster hippogriff, an equally mythical creature with the body of a pony, and the feet and wing of an eagle.

"They're not as brave as the typical horse, and I say that only because, unlike them, the hippogriffs are afraid of waves. They would fly to the ones that are just an inch high, but no matter what; they would fly away from even the most docile waves."

That is, docile when they aren't trying to beat the living daylights out of you.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

“As soon as we came through the entrance to the valley, it was obvious unicorns were a normal part of the herd population,” said researcher, A. D’Agnese.

Natives at the valley, the Habanar, had heard of unicorns, but had never seen them before.

“They’ve always made us nervous. The stories about them attacking villages, breaking people’s churches, charming the pants off of unwitting men, all of that,” said Haba Perfinchen, leader of the local Haba tribe.

So far, the entire pack of unicorns has chosen to shun the investigations of the National Geographic’s scientific group.

“But they were very pretty,” said D’Agnese.

Many around the world have celebrated the announcement.

“Finally, that irritating neighing every morning from I don’t know where has been silenced, it’s music to my ears,” said Betsy Dillig.

Unicorns have been mysterious inhabitants of the earth for centuries. It is a known fact that unicorns were the original animals invented by God, created on the 1st day itself. Abraham described seeing unicorns many times in the bible. He also related that God unleashed tuvaras as his wrath. It is unclear why God would want to use unicorns upon the earth, but this fact remains confirmed.

It is believed that all the world’s unicorns began in what is now modern-day Israel: some flying off to nearby countries, a small percentage impacting North America, others floating around the upper regions of the Himalayas, but all of them trace their roots back to the Bible. It is because of their uncommon ability to thwart God, that has caused them to become a key object in the discussed theory of evolution.

D4mVeN, long time believer and active manager of unsubstantiated paranormal claims (“I don’t know how they would have survived here for this long without a mention somewhere else,” D4mVeN said), was ecstatic, “Then, all along, was it just the Numbers 14 storyline that was talking about mutants? 27 verses can’t be wrong. The possibility is mind-boggling.”

The National Geographic team suspects the herd could be descended from a mare named Ell

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

“The search took years,” announced a spokesperson of the Columbian National Institute of Magical Sciences. “We made four expeditions into the Andes, and we never could have guessed the location of their secret valley from behind their magic mountain. All is revealed today, in this proud Columbia.”

These unisol (as the unicorns have christened themselves as) are described by field researchers as somewhat darker-coloured than the classic lilac-skinned, four-horned variety seen in most adult cartoon-versions. Columbia’s unicorns are red-maned jungle unicorns, small and burly, with one horn on the nose, two above eyes, and a tinker’s right horn on the top of their head.

What they Share with their Classically trained Unicorns

“Unisol translate to ‘United Unicorn’ in English once you reach a sparkle light of 100% Columbia.”

Although unisol share few physical characteristics with other unicorns, they resemble tiny much like those seen in popular cartoons. Unlike their American counterparts, the unisol chose to lead a quiet life in seclusion from non-magically proficient humans, and it took Columbian scientists many years to locate and contact this elusive specie.

Inhabiting a remote and isolated area of the Andes, used to protect their right to privacy and settle several border disputes between Columbia and Peru, these unisol have formed a pure society focused on the freedom to choose your own path and grow ever closer to the magic within.

Twice in recorded history the native Indians managed to sneak into the valley, bringing disease and pollution of the natural resources. Although the Poisonous Boulder cleansing ritual ended both threats, all unisol know how near they came to annihilation by those who would force their way into the valley.

However, the unisol seek to persevere and live in the U.S.A. WANTS YOU TO SUE The United Unicorns of Columbia(UUC), the democratically elected unicorns leadership body, has joined with the North American Portals Association to sue and demand in federal court that the United States legally declare their long lost kin, the USEAC, as state residents and part of the wider-up unicorns community, with full voting rights. Studies by the Magical Columbia Council on which we have a two-thirds majority hold that the unisol are indeed unicorns, both biologically and genetically,

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** Expedition leader Dr. Robert Schoonveldt, who discovered the creatures told Random Weirdness, "I know everyone thinks it's cliche, but we literally had 'unicorn-horns' on our head, seeing these creatures for the first time. They are beautiful, and I will never forget the encounter."

Schoonveldt said that it was a stroke of luck that led him to befriending the unicorns, they were surprisingly social creatures. His expedition trailed traditionally in packs of 4-5.

"The males actually grew larger then the females." says Schoonveldt. "Some of our party were a little worried to go off on their own. I don't think some of them ever saw G-Force. I NEVER carry my gun except during survival training. We wanted to be friends, and from what I could tell, the unicorns really liked us! At first they were kinda standoffish, the males more then the females. On the rain forest level, they only used their horns to fight off predators, and I think We Humans really triggered their instincts. They could feel the muscles bulging under our skin. If you sit really still, they get used to us quickly."

Most of the unicorn herd were related to each other. This proved a bit of a problem at first, as Books and Bree Lohsterus, leaders over the Initial Expedition, were all drawn to a very similar mate; Lucas Vega. Lohsterus even adapted their own kind of gibberish for book to book purpose.

"Can you believe it?" said Books. "They use pages as puppets for their children when they're in the immature stage. We haven't had to pull down the fluorescence on the lamps." Bree frequently takes note not to touch Lohsterus' wrists, as Logic, the shaman of the herd, puts out radioactive smog. This had killed 2 Observation Troopers within 2 months. It came at the blessing of a small number of villagers nearby.

Some initial concerns existed about the problem of female members. Schoonveldt and Lohsterus couldn't be bothered. SAS Cannabis farmer Chaneley Shepherd, 36, said "Look, I don't get extra-terrestrial stories. But I think they're the hardest things for SAS to handle. A lot of us think you're in a civil war, yada yada."

The herd is currently a tourist attraction. A discount rate,

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** The amazing discovery was made in one of Peru’s most inaccessible areas.

Peru is presently the 3rd world’s largest producer of drug cocaine and coca leaves. Alcohol, cigarette and methamphetamine trafficking is currently prohibited in Peru. The former is considered a major enemy of the health of the country. Demand exists not only in the South American country but among nations in North and Central America as well. Drug trafficking is considered one of the largest illegal businesses in the world.

The search team was sponsored by the Necessashist Ceres Initiative, an undertaking to build-up the economy related to the massive motive of the production of the greatest number of natural resources in the world. This enormously gigantic project will create an almost untold number of programs in advances and civilization, among which a crossing of the director of the Univeritario de Necessasblas, Dicianareitar, with the team looking for coca plants in the Amazon jungle.

This incredible discovery may well make a significant contribution to educating the young generation in “How Smart Rules the World”.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

"A thousand years in their company was just like a day," said Dr. Amy Whadowitz of Columbia University. "Or was it a year? Sure, why not one year? No matter, it recharges in less than an hour. Which, technically, is no time at all."

Over the course of the next year, Dr. Whadowitz and fellow researcher Sebastian Rodriguez compiled a detailed report of the unicorns’ unique language, their lifestyle, and the social hierarchy that they follow.

The Herd. Hundreds of cows clumped together in a large circle, around twelve feet in diameter (rho= ρ)

a) For a long time, the researchers were convinced that the unicorns were using a form of Morse code in order to communicate with each other. However, study after study showed it was, in fact, a form of whistling. "Once I heard it, boy, I had to conclude these were whistles, not Morse code," said Whadowitz.

b) Despite their frequent and regular attempts, as well as their attempts with the marijuana smoke and the water, the researchers were unable to establish a translation program into unicornspeak.

Layers. The researchers, Whadowitz and Rodriguez, were unable to ascertain exactly how many layers of government the unicorns had. However, they used their unique lung-heart combo to develop an incredibly effective system of government.

a) Unlike normal people, who can only justify feeling pleasure for an instant moment in time. The unicorns, on the other hand, were able to detach from their body’s experiences. The unicorns were able to enjoy the act of love as long as they wished (“A girl band! Yes, one of Edge of Seventeen!” extrovertedly smiled one).

a) Sadly, it’s not all smiles and fluffy tails. In fact, it is confirmed that zero measureable phenomena can be calculated to have been produced by zero unicorns in the thirteen months Whadowitz spent living with their herd. There is one exception to my storm of sadness; Whadowitz and Rodriguez discovered evidence that unicorns are indeed able to acknowledge the existence of other things.

b) Whadowitz said investigating why the unicorns loved aresults was something she considered a priority, but she feared it took away from the research. This signaled the end of their study. Without having any proof of a better way

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.** The herd of the heavenly creatures confessed to the researchers that they had figured out a long time ago that their species was actually fibbing. According to the herd, it’s completely pointless to have a horse/goat hybrid walking around. They made a decision however to carry on the lie in order to preserve their species and perhaps accept the false reality in which they reside.

Scientist from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York suggests that this particular species of unicorn is more of an apocryphal, or mythological beast. Unicorns are solely born from the seven original objects in the Paleozoic. The vessels of the seven objects are contained in the Glass Cathedral where the purist of ponies is currently residing. These unicorns are called nonpocron.

Now enough of todays modern fantasy language of, magic, dragon slaying, and forest fairies. The researchers are calling on the rest of the scientific community to double check their rapidly deteriorating reality. Although unicorns are magical beings, they are also master illusionists. For the first time in 2.6 billion years, we have been “tabooed,” and the existence of a pure magic unicorn, is beginning to show through the cracks of our false reality.

**In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.**

“I can’t believe it. It’s almost too good to be true,” said Dr. Julio Carbleoo, the scientist in charge of the discovery.

The herd of approximately four unicorns, which are known as Cuniculus Plicosus, live in a valley about 7000 feet in the mountains where the temperature rarely tops 35 degrees. Their preferred food is a tangy, orange moss that grows over the south facing rock face. They have adapted a nearly completely vegetarian diet and even to this day have never been known to kill animal.

“The unicorn is a curious animal,” Carbleoo told us. “It has a sweet face and a pleasant disposition, but seems woefully unaware that it’s one of the most beautiful, powerful creatures on the earth,” Carbleoo said. He told us he almost felt bad about harpooning one of the creatures for its hide after capturing and sedating it for research purposes. The hide was then added to his small collection of hides and will be examined by molecular biologists who will hole up in his laboratory in Santiago during the next few months to study it.

Carboleoo, who has no formal training in biology, geology or medicine, is confident that groundbreaking discoveries will be made once the DNA of the hide is examined. “My theory is that the unicorn is a creature related to the tapir,” Carbleoo said. “You should see the way this hoofed animal pole vaults over obstacles with ease. That alone is a clue that it has come from an undiscovered tapir family. No one told these poor majestic beasts not to trust humans, they have no idea we might be a threat or danger to them.”

When LamanaReport reporters visited the valley where the unicorns live they were greeted by Carbleoo who was sitting at the base of a tree, eagerly waiting for another specimen. “Maybe I should clean up my appearance before I go trudging up this mountain looking like a Grateful Dead groupie,” Carbleoo said. He explained that he prefers wearing this attire as a way to gain the unicorns trust.

“Being a fluffy paledontologist is my way of showing these majestic beasts how to love despite inhospitable environments, migratory patterns that are unclear and selfish human attitudes towards beautiful, majestic creatures.”

Carboleoo was offering fresh
