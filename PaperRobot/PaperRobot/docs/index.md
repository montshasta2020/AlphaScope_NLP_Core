## Entities:
type; diabetes; Diabetes; macrovascular disease; Pioglitazone
## System Abstract:
Introduction Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a serious health problem in the United States. The objective of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of Pioglitazone in patients with a history of macrovascular disease (T2D). Methods A comprehensive literature search was carried out on the basis of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Results The mean age of 6. 0 years was found to be a risk factor for the treatment of CVD.
## System Conclusion auncnd Future work:
In this study, we found that the incremental cost-effectiveness of Pioglitazone in patients with T2D with a history of T2DM in the United States. In addition, the results of the present meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of CVD was associated with a higher risk of the disease, but it is important for the treatment of diabetes.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to project health-economic outcomes relevant to the German setting for the addition of Pioglitazone to existing treatment regimens in patients with type 2 Diabetes, evidence of macrovascular disease and at high risk of cardiovascular events. Methods Event rates corresponding to macrovascular outcomes from the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive) study of Pioglitazone were used with a modified version of the CORE Diabetes Model to simulate outcomes over a 35-year time horizon. Direct medical costs were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective in year 2005 values. Germany specific costs were applied for patient treatment, hospitalization and management.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Based on outcomes from PROactive this modelling study demonstrates that the addition of Pioglitazone to current treatment regimens in the German setting is likely to be viewed as good value for money over patient lifetimes. There were benefits in terms of both projected life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy accompanied by cost savings from complications avoided and increased treatment and overall total lifetime costs

## Title:
Impaired Fasting Plasma glucose and type 2 diabetes Are Related to the Risk of Out-of-Hospital sudden cardiac death and All-Cause Mortality
## Entities:
type; diabetes; glucose; sudden cardiac death; death
## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between plasma glucose and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the International Classification of Out-of-Hospital (n = 152), and a free radical (ROC) curve (group B). RESULTS During the end of the disease, the proportion of the participants were all-cause mortality and the risk of death in the general population.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that plasma glucose and type 2 diabetes was associated with the risk of T2DM in the general population. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to determine whether impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and type 2 diabetes may be risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective study was based on 2,641 middle-aged men 42–60 years of age at baseline. Impaired FPG level (≥5.6 mmol/L) among nondiabetic subjects (501 men) was defined according to the established guidelines, and the group with type 2 diabetes included subjects (159 men) who were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin therapy, and/or diet. RESULTS During the 19-year follow-up, a total of 190 SCDs occurred.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study demonstrates that impaired FPG and type 2 diabetes are related to the risk of out-of-hospital SCD and all-cause death in the general population. The main finding of this study is that impaired FPG among nondiabetic subjects and type 2 diabetic subjects represents risk factors for SCD. We observed that each 1 mmol/L increment in FPG was related to a 10% elevated risk of SCD. Sudden cardiac arrest in adults is mainly due to underlying CHD, and the most common electrophysiological mechanism of SCD is ventricular arrhythmias. Previous findings suggest that myocardial as well as electrical abnormalities are likely to influence the risk of SCD (24).

Metabolic effect of Telmisartan and losartan in hypertensive patients with Metabolic syndrome
## Entities:
metabolic syndrome; telmisartan; Metabolic syndrome; hypertensive; Telmisartan; losartan
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Telmisartan and losartan on hypertensive patients with Metabolic syndrome (MS). Materials and Methods: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control group (n = 10), hypertension, triglyceride (TG), and triglycerides (IGT). Blood pressure (BP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin (LDH) were considered as the visceral fat metabolism. The results indicated that the metabolic pathway was associated with increased oxidative stress.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that Telmisartan and losartan might be a potential therapeutic option for hypertensive patients with MS.
## System New Title:
The role of Telmisartan in the treatment of losartan: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of common cardiovascular risk factors that includes hypertension and insulin resistance. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are frequent comorbidities and, like Metabolic syndrome, increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Telmisartan, an antihypertensive agent with evidence of partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity-gamma (PPARγ) activity, may improve insulin sensitivity and lipid profile in patients with Metabolic syndrome. Methods In a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study, patients with World Health Organization criteria for Metabolic syndrome received once-daily doses of Telmisartan (80 mg, n = 20) or losartan (50 mg, n = 20) for 3 months.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study found that Telmisartan, but not losartan, improves metabolic parameters in patients with Metabolic syndrome. Although treatment conventionally focuses on each risk factor individually, multifactorial intervention reduces significantly the incidence of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetics with microalbuminuria. The multifactorial effects of Telmisartan shown in this study could, therefore, provide synergistic benefits in patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as glucose intolerance. Such a provocative hypothesis will require confirmation in large clinical trials, such as the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) [ 39 ]

Associations of Gestational diabetes, Existing diabetes, and Glycosuria With Offspring obesity and Cardiometabolic Outcomes
## Entities:
diabetes; glycosuria; obesity; Glycosuria; gestational diabetes
## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of GDM among women with Offspring and Glycosuria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of the California Health Survey (n = 56), 147 (DM) born from birth to May 2008, and to identify risk factors associated with obesity, preeclampsia, and metabolic outcomes. RESULTS odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to adjust the association between gestational diabetes and maternal kidney disease (HOMA-IR).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that GDM was associated with a higher risk of obesity among women with Offspring and Glycosuria. These results suggest that the associations between gestational diabetes and metabolic outcomes are independent predictors of the association between the prevalence of DM and maternal kidney disease. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To assess associations of gestational diabetes, existing diabetes, and Glycosuria with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors in offspring at adolescence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Multivariable regression analyses were conducted in a prospective pregnancy cohort (n = 2,563–4,198 for different outcomes). Obstetric data were abstracted from clinical records. Offspring outcomes were assessed at mean age 15.5 years. Compared with those lost to follow-up, participants included in the analysis were of higher socioeconomic position. Outcomes included BMI, waist circumference, fat mass determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sBP and dBP, respectively), fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this prospective birth cohort study, we have found that at mean age 15.5 years, maternal gestational diabetes and Glycosuria were associated with higher mean fat mass and BMI z scores in simple unadjusted analyses, with the association attenuating somewhat in multivariable models. Offspring of mothers who had existing or gestational diabetes during their pregnancy had higher fasting glucose, but this was not accompanied by an increase in fasting insulin. In contrast, offspring of mothers who experienced Glycosuria in pregnancy had higher fasting insulin. We found little evidence of associations between maternal diabetes or Glycosuria and a wider range of cardiometabolic risk factors beyond glucose and insulin (i.e., no associations with dBP, sBP, lipids, or CRP

Caffeic acid phenethyl amide ameliorates ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats
## Entities:
diabetic; cardiac dysfunction; Caffeic acid; Caffeic acid phenethyl amide; caffeic acid phenethyl amide; streptozotocin; ischemia
## System Abstract:
Background Sudden diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common complication of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of streptozotocin (STZ) -induced ischemia/reperfusion injury (AKI). Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CTL), HFD + heart failure (MI), and renal artery occlusion (normal saline). At the end of ischemia reperfusion (IR) was used to evaluate the extent of cardiac complications.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the protective effect of STZ (IR) -induced ischemia/reperfusion injury in AKI and the extent of cardiac complications in diabetic rats. Therefore, it may be beneficial for the treatment of diabetes.
## System New Title:
Protective effects of STZ in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.


## Human Abstract:
Background Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) has been shown to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by various mechanisms including its antioxidant effect. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of a CAPE analog with more structural stability in plasma, caffeic acid phenethyl amide (CAPA), on I/R injury in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced type 1 diabetic rats. Methods Type 1 diabetes mellitus was induced in Sprague–Dawley rats by a single intravenous injection of 60 mg/kg STZ. To produce the I/R injury, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 45 minutes, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
STZ-induced diabetic animals suffer from deteriorated cardiac function with increased myocardial infarction following I/R. CAPA can reduce the infarct size after I/R injury, and this study demonstrated that long-term CAPA treatment reversed cardiac dysfunction in diabetic animals. The cardioprotective effect of CAPA may result from its antioxidant activity and the associated preservation of NO-dependent mechanisms. However, the mechanisms of cardiac function preservation in STZ-induced diabetic rats by 4-week CAPA treatment remain to be investigated

Association of Gestational diabetes Mellitus (GDM) with subclinical atherosclerosis: a systemic review and meta-analysis
## Entities:
diabetes; Gestational diabetes mellitus; GDM; atherosclerosis; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus
## System Abstract:
Background diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between GDM and subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify observational studies. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, CENTRAL, and ProQuest up to July 2016. We performed Medline and Embase databases. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used to estimate the prevalence of bias.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that GDM is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Relationship between diabetes and risk factors in patients with type 2 Diabetes mellitus: a population-based cohort study.


## Human Abstract:
Background Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is associated with an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is increasingly used as a noninvasive marker for subclinical atherosclerosis. Whether there is a direct correlation between GDM and elevated cIMT is still controversial. Methods PubMed, Embase and reference lists of relevant papers were reviewed. Studies assessing the relationship between GDM and cIMT were included. Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) of cIMT was calculated using random-effect models. Results Fifteen studies with a total of 2247 subjects were included in our analysis, giving a pooled WMD of 0.05 (95% confidence interval [ CI ] 0.03 –0.07
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this meta-analysis we observed GDM is related to larger cIMT, the relation is stronger in obese GDM patients, and the association already exists at the time of pregnancy and remained significant years after pregnancy. Weight control may be helpful to prevent cardiovascular diseases for GDM patients

albuminuria, cardiovascular risk factors and disease management in subjects with type 2 Diabetes: a cross sectional study
## Entities:
Albuminuria; type; diabetes; Diabetes; albuminuria
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to examine the association between microalbuminuria and disease severity in subjects with type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). Methods The prevalence of albuminuria (T2D) was assessed by the National Health Interview Survey (NHANES) and cardiovascular risk factor (CHD). The associations between glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) and waist circumference (WC) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results A total of 168 persons were included in a cohort of non-fatal stroke and Hispanics.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, the prevalence of microalbuminuria and disease severity in subjects with type 2 Diabetes was not associated with increased risk of T2DM. The association between glucose and HbA 1c levels were found to be a independent predictor of diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Epidemiological studies have shown that microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease and other vascular diseases in persons with type 2 Diabetes. In the present study we examined the prevalence and risk factors for micro- and macroalbuminuria and examined glycemic control as well as treatment of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in persons with known type 2 Diabetes in Germany. Methods The presented data were derived from the'KORA Augsburg Diabetes Family Study', conducted between October 2001 and September 2002. Participants were adults aged 29 years and older with previously diagnosed type 2 Diabetes (n = 581).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study could show that the prevalences of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in a German sample of persons with type 2 diabetes were comparable to those shown in other studies. Despite the high risk of cardiovascular events and mortality among type 2 diabetic persons, in our study control of diabetes and risk factors was not optimal. Thus, glycemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors should be intensified to effectively reduce the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetic persons

## Entities:
ARDS; critical illness; ALI; acute lung injury; acute respiratory distress syndrome
## System Abstract:
Introduction The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of angiogenic factors in acute lung injury (ALI) in patients with critical illness. Material/Methods The primary outcome was established by the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary edema (n = 147). The subjects were divided into two groups: (1) the control group (CG), and 30 healthy controls. Serum samples were collected from the alveolar phase of the lung and lungs. The expression of CRP was determined by using the Spearman ’ s test (RT-PCR) and western blotting.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that angiogenic factors may be useful for ALI in patients with critical illness. Further studies are warranted.
## System New Title:
The Effects of angiogenic on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by a disruption of the endothelium and alveolar epithelial barriers involving increased microvascular permeability, thus resulting in the set of protein-rich pulmonary edema. Angiogenic factors and their receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) /VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) and the angiopoietin (Ang) /Tie2 signALIng pathways, play pivotal roles in both angiogenesis and microvascular permeability. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between angiogenic factors, their soluble receptors and ALI/ARDS associated with critically ill patients, including sepsis, severe trauma, and post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study demonstrated that there were lower sVEGFR2 levels on day 1 and higher sVEGFR1 and Ang2 levels, and an increased Ang2/Ang1 ratio during the entire study period in patients with ALI/ARDS associated with critical illness, including sepsis, severe trauma, and PCAS. sVEGFR2 and Ang2 were found to be independent predictors of the development of ALI/ARDS in critically ill patients. In addition, sVEGFR2 and Ang2 independently predict the 28-day mortALIty in ALI/ARDS patients associated with critical illness. It should be noted that not only Ang2, but also sVEGFR2, both play a pivotal role in the development of ALI/ARDS in cases of critical illness and can predict the 28-day mortALIty in ALI/ARDS patients

## System Abstract:
Background Erythropoietin (EPO) is a devastating complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of fibrosis on cardiac function in diabetic rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly divided into three groups: control group (NS), kidney injury (MI), heart failure (0. 15 mg/kg), or vehicle (600 mg/kg/day). The animals were intraperitoneally injected with intraperitoneal injection of STZ, followed by ligation.

## Human Abstract:
Background Recent studies revealed that Erythropoietin (EPO) has tissue-protective effects in the heart by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and attenuating myocardial fibrosis in ischemia models. In this study, we investigated the effect of EPO on ventricular remodeling and blood vessel growth in diabetic rats. Methods Male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control rats, streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with 1000 U/kg EPO by subcutaneous injection once per week. Twelve weeks later, echocardiography was conducted, and blood samples were collected for counting of peripheral blood endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We observed a significant reduction in microvessel density and increased myocardial fibrosis in diabetic rats. EPO prevented the pathological changes and cardiac dysfunction through enhancing angiogenesis and attenuating interstitial fibrosis in DCM

## System Abstract:
Growing evidence supports the role of oxidative stress in the prevention of cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Doxorubicin on the amelioration of iron deficiency (AA) in rats. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 8), aged 4 to 200 mg/kg body weight (bw), i. V. Groups 2: normal saline (NS), and water (95% CIs) were administered immediately after the administration of a single dose of streptozotocin.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study showed that the protective effect of Doxorubicin on the amelioration of AA in rats. The results of the administration of these findings suggest that oxidative stress may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cardiotoxicity.

## Human Abstract:
Since anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC), a complication of anthracycline-based chemotherapies, is thought to involve iron, concerns exist about using iron for anaemia treatment in anthracycline-receiving cancer patients. This study evaluated how intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) modulates the influence of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and Doxorubicin (3–5 mg per kg body weight [ BW ]) on oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and cardiorenal function in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats. FCM was given as repeated small or single total dose (15 mg iron per kg BW), either concurrent with or three days after Doxorubicin.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
FCM did not aggravate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in iron-deficient hypertensive rats receiving chronic DOX treatment. Moreover, administration of FCM attenuated cardiorenal oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as effects on cardiac and renal morphology and function compared to saline controls

Brain natriuretic peptide is related to diastolic dysfunction whereas urinary albumin excretion rate is related to left ventricular mass in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes patients
## Entities:
type; diabetes; left ventricular mass; diastolic dysfunction; Brain natriuretic peptide
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of Brain natriuretic peptide (FABP4) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Eighty-eight hypertensive DM2 (FPG ≥ 104 ± 7. 7 years) were separated in a real-world follow-up period. Left ventricular systolic blood pressure (LVDD), myocardial diastolic glucose tolerance test (CMR), echocardiography, echocardiographic parameters, and abnormal Doppler imaging (TTE) was performed. Results The mean age of 59 months was compared with a history of diastolic dysfunction (LV mmol/l).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that FABP4 in patients with type 2 diabetes was not associated with a higher risk of diastolic dysfunction in T2DM. In addition, it was not statistically significant difference in the pathogenesis of LVDD. The prognostic value of Brain natriuretic peptide (CMR), echocardiography, and echocardiographic parameters were observed in the absence of LV mmol/l. The results of the present findings suggest that the combination of TTE may be a useful tool for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of this issue.

Background The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of left ventricular systolic (LVSD) and diastolic (LVDD) dysfunction, and to test if BNP and urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) are related to LVSD, LVD and left ventricular mass (LVM) in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes patients. Methods Presence of LVSD, LVDD and LVM, determined with echocardiography, was related to levels of BNP and AER in 153 consecutive asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. Results LVSD was present in 6.1% of patients whereas 49% (29% mild, 19% moderate and 0.7% severe) had LVDD and 9.4% had left ventricular
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that echo screening of asymptomatic diabetic subjects with apparently normal cardiac function may identify significant numbers of patients with asymptomatic LVDD and LVH. Almost half of the presumably heart healthy population had LVDD. BNP discriminates patients at high risk for moderate to severe LVDD, and might therefore be used as screening tool in order to capture patients eligible for further risk stratification with echo. LVH was associated with male gender and AER, whereas moderate LVDD was associated with female gender and BNP, implying gender specific mechanism in the development of CVD

## Entities:
COPD; budesonide; formoterol; salmeterol; steroid; fluticasone
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fixed-dose combination (200 mg) on the severity of budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone (400 μg) in patients with COPD (PC). Patients and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) was administered to a single dose of 300 mg/day for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of the 14-day and inflammatory response to the end of the disease.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that fixed-dose combination with 200 mg on the severity of budesonide/formoterol in patients with PC and 400 μg. These findings suggest that the treatment of salmeterol/fluticasone may be a useful agent for the management of the disease.

The effects of COPD in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Airway absorption and bioavailability of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) may be influenced by differences in pharmacokinetic properties such as lipophilicity and patient characteristics such as lung function. This study aimed to further investigate and clarify the distribution of budesonide and fluticasone in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by measuring the systemic availability and sputum concentration of budesonide and fluticasone, administered via combination inhalers with the respective long-acting β 2 -agonists, formoterol and salmeterol. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-way crossover, multicenter study. Following a run-in period, 28 patients with severe COPD (mean age 65 years, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [ FEV 1 ] 37.5% predicted normal) and 27 healthy subjects (mean age 31 years, FEV 1 103.3% predicted normal) received two single-dose treatments of budesonide/formoterol (400/12 μg) and salmeterol/fluticasone (50/500 μg), separated by a 4–14-day washout
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study confirmed that plasma levels of both fluticasone and budesonide are lower in subjects with severe COPD but did not demonstrate a difference in the systemic exposure between budesonide and fluticasone in severe COPD patients relative to healthy subjects. In patients with COPD, a larger fraction of fluticasone was recovered in the expectorated sputum than for budesonide, indicating that fluticasone is more extensively cleared from the airways, while budesonide is more rapidly absorbed into the airway tissue

An open label, single blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial
## Entities:
glucose; endothelial dysfunction; coronary artery disease; insulin; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; eicosapentaenoic acid; impaired glucose metabolism
## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 6-month treatment on postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: control group (n = 36), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and insulin resistance. The primary endpoint was the proportion of blood pressure (BP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that 6-month treatment with CAD and hyperlipidemia, hypertension, IL-6, and insulin resistance. These findings suggest that postprandial hyperglycemia may be useful in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Further studies are needed to confirm the effects of these drugs in the future.

Association between glucose and insulin resistance in patients with eicosapentaenoic acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Recent experimental studies have revealed that n-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) regulate postprandial insulin secretion, and correct postprandial glucose and lipid abnormalities. However, the effects of 6-month EPA treatment on postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, insulin secretion, and concomitant endothelial dysfunction remain unknown in patients with impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and results We randomized 107 newly diagnosed IGM patients with CAD to receive either 1800 mg/day of EPA (EPA group, n = 53) or no EPA (n = 54).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, EPA corrected not only postprandial hypertriglyceridemia but also postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin secretion ability. This amelioration of metabolic abnormalities was associated with improvements in concomitant endothelial dysfunction among newly diagnosed IGM patients with CAD. Though lifestyle changes remain a cornerstone in all strategy for prevention of DM, this study suggests that addition of EPA could accelerate the prevention of DM and CAD

Background We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the risk of early and late Cardiotoxicity of anthracycline agents in patients treated for breast or ovarian cancer, lymphoma, myeloma or sarcoma. Methods Randomized controlled trials were sought using comprehensive searches of electronic databases in June 2008. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also scanned for additional articles. Outcomes investigated were early or late clinical and sub-clinical Cardiotoxicity. Trial quality was assessed, and data were pooled through meta-analysis where appropriate. Results Fifty-five published RCTs were included; the majority were on women with advanced breast cancer.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Unfortunately, published data are not sufficiently robust to support clear evidence-based recommendations on different schedules of anthracyclines, or the routine use of cardiac protective agents or liposomal preparations in patients defined as at high risk for anthracycline cardiotoxicity, such as patients with known cardiac impairment and/or previous anthracycline exposure. Nonetheless, these approaches may have a role. An alternative strategy would be to avoid the use of anthracyclines in favour of newer cytotoxic drugs with equivalent efficacy, but a lower risk of cardiac effects. In breast cancer treatment this might be achieved by moving to taxane-based regimens which appear to have less cardiotoxicity in clinical trials.

The absence of reactive oxygen species production protects mice against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
## Entities:
bleomycin; oxygen; reactive oxygen species; Reactive oxygen species; pulmonary fibrosis
## System Abstract:
Background reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important cause of neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Reactive oxygen species on the incidence of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Methods Mice were divided into three groups: Control (n = 10), or saline (0. 3 mg/kg body weight). The animals were sacrificed at the time of the experiment. Results: The effects of GSH on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (ALT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by Western blotting.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the present study demonstrated that GSH on the incidence of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our findings indicate that Reactive oxygen species might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of reactive oxygen species.

The role of Reactive oxygen species in patients with bleomycin-induced: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Reactive oxygen species and tissue remodeling regulators, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs), are thought to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated these factors in the fibrotic response to bleomycin of p47 phox -/- (KO) mice, deficient for ROS production through the NADPH-oxidase pathway. Methods Mice are administered by intranasal instillation of 0.1 mg bleomycin. Either 24 h or 14 days after, mice were anesthetized and underwent either bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or lung removal. Results BAL cells from bleomycin treated WT mice showed enhanced ROS production after PMA stimulation, whereas no change was observed with BAL cells from p47 phox -/-
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, this study demonstrates that the inability of phagocytes from p47 phox -/- KO mice to produce large quantities of ROS via the NADPH oxidase pathway inhibits the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This inhibition is associated with changes in IL-6 production and in the molar MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, both probably key factors in airway remodeling and fibrosis. These rapidity of these differences after bleomycin administration suggests that early inflammatory events and remodeling events may establish a favorable environment for further chronic fibrogenic processes

## Human Abstract:
Background Several animal models have facilitated the evaluation and pathological understanding of atherosclerosis, but a definitive animal model of coronary atherosclerosis is not available. We therefore developed low density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-KO) pigs with hypercholesterolemia, a model which rapidly developed coronary atherosclerosis following balloon injury. Methods and Results We deleted LDLR exon regions from cultured porcine fetal fibroblasts and cloned LDLR knockout (LDLR-KO) embryos microinjecting fetal fibroblast nuclei into enucleated oocytes. Twelve LDLR-KO pigs were fed a 2.0% cholesterol and 20% fat diet. Baseline serum LDL cholesterol level was 510.0±86.1 mg/dL.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We established a model of accelerated Coronary atherosclerosis using LDLR-KO pigs with Balloon Injury. This model can be useful as a preclinical tool for pharmacology or devices and as an aid to investigate the mechanism of plaque formation and progression

## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Salidroside on the left carotid artery and ventricular regional systolic dysfunction in patients with breast cancer (BC). Materials and Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint was a 6-month history of the disease and the exact mechanism was evaluated. The results showed that the addition of these two groups were significantly higher in the control group (P < 0. 01), and the levels of increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (BUN), fibrinogen, and total blood pressure (BP).
## System Conclusion and Future work:

## Human Abstract:
Background Salidroside [ 2- (4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl-β-D-glucopyranoside ], one of the most potent ingredients extracted from the plant Rhodiola rosea L. , has been shown to have a cardiovascular protective effect as an antioxidant, and early treatment of epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity has been the focus of clinical chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. However, the cardioprotective effects of Salidroside on epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, especially early left ventricular regional systolic dysfunction, have to date been sparsely investigated. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of Salidroside in preventing early left ventricular regional systolic dysfunction induced by epirubicin.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our preliminary study demonstrated that Salidroside can provide a protective effect against epirubicin-induced early left ventricular regional systolic dysfunction in patients with breast cancer, and the protective effects provided by Salidroside may be explained by its reduction of oxidative stress

## System Abstract:
Background: Snail is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. However, it has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of negatively on the expression of maspin in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis were used to determine whether the demethylating agent was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results showed that the binding protein plays a significant role in the regulation of tumor growth and progression.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrates that Snail negatively inhibited the expression of Maspin in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and in vitro. Our results indicate that the combination of the demethylating agent might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.
## System New Title:
The role of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the rat model of prostate cancer cells


## Human Abstract:
Background: Maspin, a putative tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in breast and prostate cancer, has been associated with decreased cell motility. Snail transcription factor is a zinc finger protein that is increased in breast cancer and is associated with increased tumor motility and invasion by induction  of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Snail increases tumor motility and invasion utilizing prostate cancer cells. Methods: Expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Cell motility and invasion assays were performed , while Snail regulation and binding to maspin promoter was analyzed by luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Results: Snail protein expression was higher in different prostate cancer cells lines as compared to normal prostate epithelial cells.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Collectively, our results indicate for the first time that Snail can negatively regulate maspin through direct promoter repression resulting in increased migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. This study reveals a novel mechanism of how Snail may function and show the importance of therapeutic targeting of Snail signaling in future.

## System Abstract:
Background death is a major risk factor for obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to determine whether the effect of Ischemic ECG abnormalities (IHD) in subjects with chronic heart disease, also known to be associated with mortality. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the out-patient department between January 2009 and December 2012. We analyzed the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the first time period. Results We found that the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was significantly higher in asthmatic patients.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that IHD is associated with mortality in asthmatic patients with chronic heart disease. The effect of Ischemic ECG abnormalities on the risk of COPD in subjects with a high level of the ROC curve was found to be a potential predictor for the treatment of obstructive pulmonary disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

## Human Abstract:
Abstract presentation An abstract, including parts of the results, has been presented at an oral session at the European Respiratory Society International Conference, London, UK, September 2016. Background Cardiovascular comorbidity contributes to increased mortality among subjects with COPD. However, the prognostic value of ECG abnormalities in COPD has rarely been studied in population-based surveys. Aim To assess the impact of ischemic ECG abnormalities (I-ECG) on mortality among individuals with COPD, compared to subjects with normal lung function (NLF), in a population-based study. Methods During 2002–2004, all subjects with FEV 1 /VC < 0.70 (COPD, n=993) were identified from population-based cohorts, together with age- and sex-matched referents without
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This population-based study shows that although I-ECG are associated with a higher mortality both among subjects with NLF and COPD, only individuals with COPD and I-ECG had a significant increased risk for death when adjusted for confounders. Among those with COPD, the almost doubled risk for death associated with I-ECG was independent of disease severity, which was assessed as the FEV 1% predicted. Furthermore, I-ECG was associated with an increased risk for death among subjects without previously reported heart disease. These findings indicate that a simple resting ECG may be a valuable tool in the clinic setting to detect ischemic abnormalities of prognostic value among subjects with COPD, independent of previously

Comparison of cAMP in the treatment of myocarditis in patients with carvedilol: a retrospective cohort study.


## Human Abstract:
Background The role of β-adrenergic stimulation on viral myocarditis has been investigated in animal models of viral myocarditis. Excess stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines causes phosphorylation/activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) by the cAMP signaling pathway. CREB as an important regulator of gene expression mediates the cardiovascular remodeling process and promotes anti-inflammatory immune responses. However, the CREB expression and phosphorylation have not been studied, and the effects of carvedilol (a nonselective β-adrenoceptor antagonist) on the CREB has not been investigated in the setting of acute viral myocarditis. Methods This study was therefore designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on the transcriptional factor CREB in a murine model of acute viral
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The expression and phosphorylation of CREB were decreased in murine coxsackievirus-induced acute viral myocarditis. Administration of Carvedilol causes an increase in the expression and phosphorylation of CREB together with the reduction in the production of IL-6 and TNF-α. The levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were correlated with the expression of CREB or pCREB. Although the cardiac transcriptional factor CREB appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of viral myocarditis, further research to reveal signaling pathways or collaborating proteins that are selectively involved in its proinflammatory or its anti-inflammatory functions is needed

## System Abstract:
Introduction altitude is a common cause of venous thrombosis in a majority of patients. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with a history of sudden onset of acute pancreatitis in a rural North emergency department. The patient was treated with HAPE. His initial presentation was found to be a result of suspicion of the bile ducts in the presence of the enteric nervous system. Conclusion We concluded that the coexistence of high altitude in the first trimester of the lower quadrant of a Himalayan -like in a small subgroup of the intervertebral disc is not well described in the literature.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we report a rare case of a Himalayan -like in a small patient with a history of acute pancreatitis. The coexistence of high altitude in the first trimester of the lower quadrant of the intervertebral disc is the most important factor for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis in patients presenting with HAPE.

Clinical benefit of edema in patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction High altitude pulmonary edema is a non-cardiogenic form of pulmonary edema that develops in unacclimatized individuals at altitudes over 2500 m. Early recognition of symptoms and immediate descent are important for successful treatment. Despite early signs and symptoms of high altitude illness, many trekkers tend to push themselves to the maximum limit. Some of them, such as the case reported here, choose to ascend on horse-back which is extremely dangerous and can be fatal. Case presentation A 55 years of age Indian ethnic South African lady was emergency air-lifted from 4410 m altitude in the Nepal Himalayas to Kathamandu (1300 m) with a suspected case of high altitude pulmonary edema.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Many individuals have invested significant time, money and physical efforts to go high altitude. They will be determined to ascend even at the cost of one ’ s health. Continuing ascent in the face of worsening symptom by using other means of transport should always be discouraged. Although acetazolamide is used for prophylaxis and treatment of acute mountain sickness (AMS), it has no established role in the prevention and treatment of HAPE. Descent is the golden rule in all high altitude illnesses. It will be wise to descend for any undiagnosed illnesses at high altitude among sojourners.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To determine whether regular aspirin use (≥75 mg/day) is independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in community-based patients with type 2 Diabetes and no history of CVD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Of the type 2 diabetic patients recruited to the longitudinal observational Fremantle Diabetes Study, 651 (50.3 %) with no prior CVD history at entry between 1993 and 1996 were followed until death or the end of June 2007, representing a total of 7,537 patient-years (mean ± SD 11.6 ± 2.9 years). Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine independent baseline predictors of CVD and all-cause mortality including regular aspirin use.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We found that regular use of Aspirin by community-based patients with type 2 diabetes and no prior history of CVD was independently associated with a reduction in subsequent CVD and all-cause mortality of at least 50% . The effect was most pronounced in subgroups comprising males and those patients aged ≥65 years. Although the present data are observational, they add weight to recommendations from bodies such as ESC, EASD, and ADA (1, 2) that Aspirin should be used in a primary prevention setting to reduce the potentially devastating effects of CVD complicating type 2 diabetes in all but the lowest risk patients (those who are young and without recognized vascular risk factors

## System Abstract:
Background Insulin resistance (IR) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Insulin resistance and glycemic abnormalities in Chinese patients with left ventricular mass index (BMI). Methods From a cross-sectional design, we investigated the relationship between glycemia and deterioration in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. The primary endpoint was to assess the association between MMPs and TNF-α in the presence of insulin resistance, and to the question of the clinical relevance of these variables.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results indicate that Insulin resistance and glycemic abnormalities in Chinese patients with left ventricular mass in the presence of BMI. Our findings suggest that MMPs may be useful for the treatment of insulin resistance. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our understanding of this association.

The role of Insulin resistance in the treatment of glycemic abnormalities: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is considered a precursor of diabetic cardiomyopathy, while Insulin Resistance (IR) is a precursor of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and independently predicts heart failure (HF). We assessed whether IR and abnormalities of the glucose metabolism are related to LVDD. Methods We included 208 patients with normal ejection fraction, 57 (27 %) of whom had T2DM before inclusion. In subjects without T2DM, an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) was performed. IR was assessed using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study suggests that IR and glucose metabolism disorders are independently associated with LVDD, supporting the relevance of LVDD in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Patients with IR and glucose metabolism disorders might represent a target population to prevent the development of HF. Screening programs should address the assessment of diastolic function and therapeutic options capable of improving Insulin sensitivity might be considered in the treatment of these patients at risk for the development of heart failure

The aim of the study was to investigate if the option to choose from, and interchange between a selection of diets (“ Choice ”), as opposed to being prescribed one set diet (“ No Choice ”), improves drop out rates and leads to improved weight loss and cardio-metabolic outcomes. Methods The study was a 12 month, randomized parallel intervention. A total of 144 volunteers with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes and a BMI 27 were randomized to “ No Choice ” or “ Choice
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the option to change dietary patterns did not improve retention rates in this weight loss intervention, although gender differences exist in terms of diet selection and weight loss outcomes. For men, clear direction was important. Current dietetic practice generally places little emphasis on gender-specific approaches when offering nutritional advice for weight loss and diabetes management. This is particularly pertinent in the case of women with chronic physical medical conditions who may be attempting to make lifestyle changes without their family ’ s support or willingness to adapt to different dietary patterns. Prescribing a set weight loss regimen to such a patient without consideration of such familial obstacles is more likely to be ineffective and may in fact contribute to the person ’ s low self-esteem (and further weight gain) from repeated failed

Association between heart failure and risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
An exaggerated increase in circulatory blood volume is linked to congestive Heart Failure. Despite this increase, reduction of the “ effective circulatory blood volume ” in congestive Heart Failure is associated with decreased cardiac output, and can weaken the sensitivity of baroreceptors. Thereafter, tonic inhibition of the baroreceptor-mediated afferent pathway of vagal nerves is removed, providing an increase in non-osmotic release of arginine Vasopressin (AVP). In the renal collecting duct, the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel is regulated by sustained elevation of AVP release, and this leads to augmented hydroosmotic action of AVP, that results in exaggerated water retention and dilutional hyponatremia.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present review paper demonstrated Hyponatremia is associated with Heart Failure. Impaired renal water excretion is closely associated with an exaggerated release of AVP in Heart Failure. In the renal collecting duct both short-term and long-term regulation of AQP2 is activated by sustained elevation of AVP, participating in renal water retention and dilutional Hyponatremia. In addition, Hyponatremia is a predictor for worsening Heart Failure in patients, and such Hyponatremia associated with organ damage predicts the short-term and long-term outcomes of Heart Failure

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 32 cases of thrombus between January 2006 and June 2016. The primary endpoint was the proportion of ICU admission, and to define the association between groups and the risk of death. We also examined the role of PCT in a cohort of neonatal intensive care unit. Patients were included in this retrospective review.

## Human Abstract:
Background Elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is frequently observed in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However, the mechanisms underlying cTnI release in these patients are still unknown. To date no data regarding coagulation disturbances as a possible mechanism for cTnI release during sepsis are available. Methodology/Principal Findings Consecutive patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis or septic shock without evidence of an acute coronary syndrome were analyzed. Coagulation parameters (clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness (MCF), α-angle) were assessed in native whole blood samples, and using specific activators to evaluate the extrinsic and intrinsic as well as the fibrin component of the coagulation pathway with the use of rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In a relatively small group of patients with SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock we found no differences in coagulation parameters analyzed with rotational thromboelastometry between cTnI-positive and -negative patients. According to the results of the present study, other mechanisms than thrombus-associated myocardial damage might play a major role in cTnI-positive patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that cytokines, especially TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 appear to play a pivotal role in mediating the hemodynamic effects and the release of cardiac troponin In patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Proposed mechanisms are cytokine-mediated reversible myocardial membrane leakage and/or apoptosis.

## System Abstract:
Background Insulin resistance (IR) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between triglyceride levels and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Serum glucose tolerance tests (HOMA-IR) was measured in 196 subjects with asymptomatic, and to evaluate the association between serum insulin resistance and coronary artery stenosis. Plasma samples were collected from baseline to 12 weeks of age, sex, body weight, and fasting blood pressure (BP).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that triglyceride levels are associated with insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to investigate the association between serum insulin resistance and coronary artery stenosis in T2DM subjects with asymptomatic IR.

## Human Abstract:
Background Insulin resistance is one of the most important contributing factors to cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to investigate the association between coronary artery stenosis (CAS) and triglyceride glucose index (TyG index), a simple insulin resistance marker, in asymptomatic subjects with type 2 diabetes. Methods We recruited asymptomatic adults with type 2 diabetes but without previous history of coronary heart disease (n = 888). Significant CAS was defined as maximum intraluminal stenosis ≥70% by coronary CT angiography. TyG index was calculated as log [ fasting triglycerides (mg/dl) x fasting glucose (mg/dl) /2 ].
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the TyG index is associated with an increased risk of CAS in asymptomatic subjects with type 2 diabetes, particularly when they have other risk factors. The TyG index may be used as a marker for insulin resistance and help identify subjects at high risk of CVD in asymptomatic subjects with type 2 diabetes. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate whether TyG index can predict cardiovascular events in these subjects

## Human Abstract:
Left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony is associated with poor prognosis in patients with Heart Failure (HF). The mechanisms leading to LV dyssynchrony are not fully elucidated. This study evaluates whether myocardium regional variation in interstitial fibrosis is associated with LV dyssynchrony. Forty-two patients with systolic Heart Failure (SHF), 76 patients with Heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and 20 patients without HF received cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. LV was divided into 18 segments by short-axis view. In each segment, regional extracellular volume fraction (ECV) and the time taken to reach minimum regional volume (Tmv) were derived.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we demonstrated that LV myocardium regional variation in interstitial fibrosis is a major determinant of LV intra-ventricular dyssynchrony irrespective of the LV global function. These data might help explain the pathophysiology of LV dyssynchrony and it ’ s underlying mechanisms leading to poor prognosis. There are several limitations of the study. First, this study design was cross-sectional, we could not clarify the causal relationship between regional interstitial fibrosis and dyssynchrony. Second, our study has no histological evidence to validate the results regarding the changes of myocardial ECV because all subjects have no indication for endomyocaridal biopsy.

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to determinate the effect of HyperuriceMIa (CAF) and untreated gout (MI) in patients with a acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Methods A total of 128 cases were included in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, clinical trial. The primary endpoint was established by logistic regression analysis. Results We found that the presence of a single dose of 25 (OH) D) was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CHD) and overall survival (OS).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that CAF is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with AMI.

Association between myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events in patients with acute Myocardial Infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Patients with a history of Myocardial Infarction (MI) are often at risk for complications, including subsequent MI and death. Use of prognostic markers may aid in preventing these poor outcomes. HyperuriceMIa is associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or mortality; however, it is unknown if serum urate (sUA) levels predict outcomes in patients with previous MI. The purpose of this study was to assess hyperuriceMIa as a biomarker of CHD outcomes in such patients. Methods These were post hoc analyses of datasets from the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study, a 1:1 randoMIzed, double-blind clinical trial, conducted from 1975 to 1979, that exaMIned mortality rates following daily aspirin adMInistration over three years in individuals with documented
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The data presented here suggest that hyperuriceMIa is an independent predictor of all-cause and CHD mortality, as well as coronary incidence, in individuals with confirmed CHD. Analysis of sUA levels in patients following MI may be a reliable and inexpensive method for distinguishing patients at risk for mortality. Measurement of sUA levels may contribute to existing strategies that stratify risk for secondary CHD events, including mortality, in patients with previous MI

Association between serum levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Considerable evidence suggests that Bilirubin is a potent physiologic antioxidant that may provide important protection against cardiovascular disease (CVD) and inflammation. We investigated the relationship between serum total Bilirubin (TB) levels and arterial stiffness, measured by the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,711 subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (807 men and 904 women; mean age, 57.1 years). The subjects were stratified based on gender-specific tertiles of TB values, and a high baPWV was defined as greater than 1,745 cm/s (75th percentile).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Low TB levels were significantly associated with arterial stiffness in Korean women with Type 2 diabetes. Our data suggested that Bilirubin may protect against macrovascular disease in women with Type 2 diabetes, similar to its protective effects in the general population

toll-like receptor-4 Mediated inflammation Is Involved in the Cardiometabolic Alterations Induced by Intermittent hypoxia
## Entities:

## System Abstract:
Background Hypoxia is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by microglia and remodeling. However, little is known about the role of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the neonatal microenvironment induced by hypoxia. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-26b and IL-6 in the Cardiometabolic gene signature. Methods Male Wistar rats were challenged with normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Normal livers were exposed to normoxia (CO 2) or toll-like receptor-4 (OGD) or vehicle (n = 0. 004). Histological examination revealed a significant decrease in monocyte chemoattractant protein (TNFα) and inflammation.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results indicate that miR-26b and IL-6 in the neonatal microenvironment induced by hypoxia in the Cardiometabolic gene signature pathway. These findings suggest that HIF-1α may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Hypoxia.

The role of inflammation in the rat model of hypoxia.


## Human Abstract:
Objective. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a major component of sleep apnea syndrome as its cardiometabolic complications have been mainly attributed to IH. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood but there are some similarities with the obesity-associated cardiometabolic complications. As the latter results from inflammation involving toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling, we assessed this pathway in the cardiometabolic consequences of IH. Methods. Lean adult male TLR4-deficient (TLR4 −/−) mice and their controls (C57BL/6 mice) were exposed to either IH (FiO 2 21-5% , 1 min cycle, 8 h/day) or air (normoxic mice) for 4 weeks.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We showed in nonobese C57BL/6 mice that IH induced morphological and inflammatory remodeling of aorta and epididymal white adipose tissue, as well as insulin resistance. These alterations were prevented in TLR4-deficient mice suggesting that IH-induced cardiometabolic consequences involved inflammation mediated by TLR4 signaling. The precise mechanisms and the specific role of one type of tissue or cell (e.g., adipose tissue) remain to be determined as TLR4 knockout used in the study was not cell specific. TLR4 is indeed expressed on many cell types, predominantly those of the immune system, but also on nonhematopoietic cell types (e.g., endothelial, epithelial cells, etc.).

## System Abstract:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the kinetics of Doxorubicin (TiO 2) and Liposomal (ICG) in the presence of doxorubicin (DOX) in solid carcinoma (HepG2). In this work, we investigated the effect of apoferritin (MO) on dialysis surfaces. The MTT assay was used to investigate the relationship between the mono- and the cytotoxicity of the unfolded protein (pH). In this paper, we evaluated the effects of a combination of CDDP (Dox) on the surface of cell lines.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the results of this study showed that MO could be a useful agent for the treatment of DOX in the presence of cell lines. In addition, it is concluded that the combination of TiO 2 and ICG might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the development of dialysis.

The effect of toxicity on Doxorubicin and apoptosis in a rat model of pituitary: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Doxorubicin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug, however, its toxicity is a significant limitation in therapy. Encapsulation of Doxorubicin inside liposomes or ferritin cages decreases cardiotoxicity while maintaining anticancer potency. We synthesized novel apoferritin- and liposome-encapsulated forms of Doxorubicin (“ Apodox ” and “ lip-8-dox ”) and compared its toxicity with Doxorubicin and Myocet on prostate cell lines. Three different prostatic cell lines PNT1A, 22Rv1, and LNCaP were chosen. The toxicity of the modified Doxorubicin forms was compared to conventional Doxorubicin using the MTT assay, real-time cell impedance-based cell growth method (RTCA), and flow cytometry.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study focused on comparison of toxicity of novel modified forms of Doxorubicin prepared in our lab. Despite the differences between assays, Doxorubicin was the most toxic of tested compounds. This study confirmed lower toxicity of commercially available Myocet and also of modifications prepared in our lab—apoferritin-coated apodox and liposome-coated lip-8-dox, which complies with the initial premise. Most importantly, it was demonstrated, that liposomal modification “ lip-8-dox ” exhibits higher toxicity to tumorous cell lines, but is significantly less toxic for non-tumour cells. Based on this pilot study, precise mechanisms of coated Doxorubicin modifications and their effects on in vivo models will be the subject of future experiments

Prevalence of HIV infection in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Hypertension and Diabetes prevalence is high in Africans. Data from HIV infected populations are limited, especially from Malawi. Integrating care for chronic non-communicable co-morbidities in well-established HIV services may provide benefit for patients by preventing multiple hospital visits but will increase the burden of care for busy HIV clinics. Methods Cross-sectional study of adults (≥18 years) at an urban and a rural HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi, during 2014. Hypertension and Diabetes were diagnosed according to stringent criteria. Proteinuria, non-fasting lipids and cardio/cerebro-vascular disease (CVD) risk scores (Framingham and World Health Organization/International Society for Hypertension) were determined.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Among adult Malawian HIV patients in care we found high combined prevalence of mostly newly diagnosed hypertension and diabetes. Integrated HIV-hypertension-diabetes care may be individually beneficial but increases the burden of care for busy HIV clinics. Excluding patients with mild hypertension and low CVD risk from drug treatment would half the overall burden of HIV patients in need of integrated pharmacotherapy for diabetes and/or hypertension. More research on CVD risk in HIV infected Africans is urgently needed to generate evidence that is based on clinical endpoints. The individual benefits of integrated care for hypertension and diabetes at HIV clinics needs further study as well as the optimal model of care

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the United States (n = 53), and the remaining healthy controls. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was used to assess the relationship between Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the severity of the disease progression. RESULTS There was no significant improvement in the incidence of diastolic dysfunction (< 0. 001), and the adjusted regression analyses were performed to examine the association between baseline levels of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other confounding factors.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was found to be an independent risk factor for the development of diastolic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of T2DM. The association between Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease levels and the severity of the disease is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between baseline and other confounding factors. The results of the present findings suggest that eGFR may be a useful tool for the prevention of diabetic nephropathy in the management of DM. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our understanding of this issue.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE Data on cardiac function in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are limited and conflicting. We assessed whether NAFLD is associated with abnormalities in cardiac function in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 50 consecutive type 2 diabetic individuals without a history of ischemic heart disease, hepatic diseases, or excessive alcohol consumption, in whom NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography. A tissue Doppler echocardiography with myocardial strain measurement was performed in all patients. RESULTS Thirty-two patients (64 %) had NAFLD, and when compared with the other 18 patients, age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, smoking, diabetes duration, microvascular complication status, and medication use were not significantly
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We have shown for the first time that in type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD, features of early, subclinical LV diastolic dysfunction may be detected, as measured by two-dimensional echocardiography using tissue Doppler imaging, which is currently the preferred diagnostic approach for evaluating subclinical changes in LV function (4 – 7). Additionally, because diastolic dysfunction was not detected by conventional echocardiography, our results provide further evidence that tissue Doppler imaging is more accurate and sensitive than conventional echocardiography for detecting early alterations in LV diastolic function in type 2 diabetic patients (4 – 7).

## System Abstract:
Introduction Pulmonary pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare condition that is characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. We herein report a case of a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Case presentation A 55-year-old Caucasian woman presented with fever and shortness of breath. He was admitted to our hospital for the last 3 years of age. He had a right lower quadrant pain. He was diagnosed with lethargy, who had been treated with bosentan.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we report a rare case of a patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We believe that PH can be considered as an alternative option for patients with bosentan. The diagnosis of PVR should be carefully monitored for the management of the WHO.

The effect of aneurysm on the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Pulmonary artery aneurysms are a rare condition, frequently associated with pulmonary hypertension. However, the evolution and treatment of this pathology is still not clear. Case Presentation The authors report a case of a 65-year old patient with pulmonary artery aneurysm associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Due to a positive vasoreactivity test, treatment with calcium channel blockers was started with near normalization of the right cardiac pressures. Nevertheless, after 20 months of treatment, the pulmonary artery aneurysm size remained unchanged with an associated severe pulmonary regurgitation and causing extrinsic compression of the main left coronary artery.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The case report presented illustrates a case of PA aneurysm diagnosed on a living patient with PH. Although this association is rather frequent, this is the first case described associated with vasoreactive PH. Despite medical therapy for PH being commenced no size reduction was observed on PA aneurysm. aneurysmectomy was then performed and PA aneurysm was successfully replaced by allograft tissue

## System Abstract:
Background The serine/threonine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been shown to be a promising strategy to treat cancer cells. However, little is known about the effect of chemotherapies on cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Methods In this study, we investigated the effects of TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8 and cytotoxic agents on the growth of lung cancer. Results Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot analysis was used to determine the antitumor activity of the apoptotic pathway in a concentration-dependent manner.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that chemotherapies inhibited cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that inhibition of TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8 and cytotoxic agents may be a promising therapeutic agent for NSCLC treatment.

## Human Abstract:
Background Activation of caspase-9 in response to treatment with cytotoxic drugs is inhibited in NSCLC cells, which may contribute to the clinical resistance to chemotherapy shown in this type of tumor. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of caspase-9 inhibition, with a focus on a possible role of TUCAN as caspase-9 inhibitor and a determinant of chemosensitivity in NSCLC cells. Methods Caspase-9 processing and activation were investigated by Western blot and by measuring the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate LEHD-AFC. Proteins interaction assays, and RNA interference in combination with cell viability and apoptosis assays were used to investigate the involvement of TUCAN in inhibition of caspase-9 and chemosensitivity
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
These results indicate that procaspase-9 is functional and can undergo full processing in the presence of additional cytochrome c/dATP. However, the inhibitory protein TUCAN detectable only in NSCLC cells does not play a role in inhibition of procaspase-9 and in the determining of sensitivity to cisplatin

## System Abstract:
Background breast cancer is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to assess the association between Physical activity and ischemic stroke in patients with incident Disease (DM). Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from the National Health Insurance Database of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results The median age ranges of all-cause mortality was significantly higher than those of the general population.

Objective To quantify the dose-response associations between total physical activity and risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke events. Design Systematic review and Bayesian dose-response meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed and Embase from 1980 to 27 February 2016, and references from relevant systematic reviews. Data from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health conducted in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa from 2007 to 2010 and the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2011 were used to map domain specific physical activity (reported in included studies) to total activity.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the findings of this study showed that a higher level of total physical activity is strongly associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke, with most health gains occurring at a total activity level of 3000-4000 MET minutes/week. Results suggest that total physical activity needs to be several times higher than the recommended minimum level of 600 MET minutes/week for larger reductions in the risk of these diseases. With population ageing, and an increasing number of cardiovascular and diabetes deaths since 1990, 36 greater attention and investments in interventions to promote physical activity in the general public is required.

The Relationship between myocardial infarction and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in patients with acute ST: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH) and microvascular obstruction (MVO) represent reperfusion injury after reperfused ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with prognostic impact and “ hypointense core ” (HIC) appearance in T 2 -weighted images. We aimed to distinguish between IMH and MVO by using T 2 * -weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and analysed influencing factors for IMH development. Methods and results A total of 151 patients with acute STEMI underwent CMR after primary angioplasty. T 2 -STIR sequences were used to identify HIC, late gadolinium enhancement to visualise MVO and T 2 * -weighted sequences to detect IMH.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
IMH is a frequent finding in reperfused STEMI associated with reduced ventricular function and myocardial damage, which can be assessed by CMR. Our data indicates—in concordance with other recently published data [ 33 – 36 ] —that T 2 * mapping seems to be more suitable than T 2 -weighted images alone for the detection of IMH in reperfused acute myocardial infarction. Despite the fact that it is rather closely correlated with a HIC in T 2 -weighted images and MVO in LGE images, it can also occur alone according to our results. In a larger trial with additional follow-up examinations and especially the use of a full left ventricular coverage of T 2 * mapping, it has to be proven if this is really a separate phenomenon to MVO with a clinical and prognostic impact or just another possibility to detect MVO with a higher sensitivity as compared to T 2 -weighted STIR and LGE

OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of dietary flavonoids on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in postmenopausal women with type 2 Diabetes on established statin and hypoglycemic therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Despite being medicated, patients with type 2 Diabetes have elevated CVD risk, particularly postmenopausal women. Although dietary flavonoids have been shown to reduce CVD risk factors in healthy participants, no long-term trials have examined the additional benefits of flavonoids to CVD risk in medicated postmenopausal women with type 2 Diabetes. We conducted a parallel-design, placebo-controlled trial with type 2 diabetic patients randomized to consume 27 g/day (split dose) flavonoid-enriched chocolate (containing 850 mg flavan-3-ols [ 90 mg epicatechin ] and 100 mg isoflavones [ aglycone equivalents) ] /day) or matched placebo for 1
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this 1-year, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial, a combined intake of flavan-3-ols and isoflavones significantly improved lipoprotein status and markers of insulin sensitivity and attenuated the estimated 10-year risk of CHD in postmenopausal women receiving standard therapy for type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the only long-term flavonoid trial that has been conducted in medicated postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes, and these data highlight the additional benefit of dietary flavonoids to standard drug therapy in managing CVD risk in these patients. All patients were receiving statin therapy (≥40 mg simvastatin or ≥10 mg atorvastatin) as part of standard medical care, but flavonoid intervention resulted in further improvements in lipoprotein status, specifically significant reductions in LDL-C and total-C: HDL-C

## System Abstract:
Background bladder distension (BA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The objective of this study was to investigate the role of inflammation in the rat model of the rats and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Wild-type (WT) mice were divided into two groups (n=10), or vehicle (control group). The animals were sacrificed at the time of a single dose of streptozotocin (500 mg/kg) or saline (100 mg/kg/day) for 24 h. Levels of NF-κB, interleukin-6, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and inflammatory responses were determined by ELISA.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrates that inflammation is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of the rat model of the rats. The results suggested that BA is a promising candidate for treating NF-κB, which may be related to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, and inflammatory responses.

## Human Abstract:
Background Mycotic infections of the bladder produce pain and inflammatory changes. The present study examined the inflammatory and nociceptive effects of the yeast cell wall component, zymosan, when admininstered into the urinary bladder in order to characterize this form of bladder sensitization. Methods Parametric analyses of the time-course (0–48 hr) and concentration (0–2% solutions) variables associated with intravesical zymosan-induced bladder inflammation were performed in female rats. Plasma extravasation of Evan's Blue dye was used as a measure of tissue inflammation. Cardiovascular and visceromotor responses to urinary bladder distension were used as measures of nociception.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study parametrically examined responses to the intravesical administration of Zymosan and demonstrated that this substance inflamed the bladder within 4 hr of administration and produced maximal inflammation 24 hr after topical administration. Statistically significant increases in ABP and EMG responses to UBD also occurred 24 hr post-Zymosan administration but not at earlier timepoints. This suggests that any subsequent studies utilizing a single dose of intravesical Zymosan to inflame the bladder would be optimized by a protocol in which pretreatment with a Zymosan solution occurs 24 hr prior to subsequent measures

Methods A total of 224 patients with China participated in a private clinic between January 2006 and December 2007. The primary endpoint was the proportion of all subjects and to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of these two agents. Results: The results showed that there was no significant difference in the improvement of the body mass index (P < 0. 01) and 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that acarbose is a useful tool for the treatment of type 2 Diabetes in Chinese population. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this study.

## Human Abstract:
Objective To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus acarbose as monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China. Methods The Cardiff Diabetes Model, an economic model designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of comparator therapies in Diabetes was used to simulate disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on patients. Systematic literature reviews, hospital surveys, meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparison were conducted to obtain model-required patient profiles, clinical data and costs. Health insurance costs (2015¥) were estimated over 40 years from a healthcare payer perspective.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Dapagliflozin is a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients as a monotherapy in treating T2DM from the perspective of health care payers in China, demonstrating a little QALY gain and lower costs compared with Acarbose monotherapy. Dapagliflozin may offer a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative initial medication for treatment-naive patients with T2DM in China; it may address some of the unmet medical needs due to adverse events (e.g., hypoglycemia, weight gain, gastrointestinal adverse event) or inconvenient drug administration in the treatment of T2DM, and continually to reduce the disease burden of T2DM

Treatment of patients with type 2 Diabetes with exenatide once weekly versus oral glucose-lowering medications or insulin glargine: achievement of glycemic and cardiovascular goals
## Entities:
type; diabetes; Diabetes; glucose; Exenatide; glycemic and cardiovascular goals; exenatide
## System Abstract:
Background type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common health problem. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of exenatide alone in patients with glucose (T2D). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the United States (n = 15), and to evaluate the effect of oral administration on the quality of life (QoL) and insulin resistance. Patients were divided into three groups: control group (EG), and Diabetes mellitus.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that oral administration of exenatide alone in patients with T2D and insulin resistance in the United States. Therefore, it is important to confirm the efficacy and safety of the treatment of T2DM. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.
## System New Title:
Effects of exenatide on postprandial function in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Diabetes is associated with a higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. To improve the health outcomes of patients with type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended target goals for the improvement of glycemic control and the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors associated with the disease. This retrospective analysis calculated the absolute benefit increase (ABI) of using exenatide once weekly (QW), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, vs an oral glucose-lowering medication or insulin glargine to achieve ADA-recommended goals. The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve these goals was also calculated and provides a useful clinical metric for comparing potential therapies from different drug
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This analysis compares the ability of exenatide QW vs commonly used glucose-lowering therapies representative of other drug classes (eg, biguanides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or basal insulin) to assist patients in reaching important therapeutic goals. The results from clinical trials indicate that for the majority of ADA-recommended therapeutic goals, exenatide QW assists more patients in reaching the goal than treatment with sitagliptin, pioglitazone, or insulin glargine. The NNTs provided here indicate that fewer patients need to be treated with exenatide QW than with sitagliptin, pioglitazone or insulin glargine to attain the same composite goal of glycemic control without weight gain or hypoglycemia.

## Human Abstract:
Aims High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an abundant and ubiquitous nuclear DNA-binding protein that has multiple functions dependent on its cellular location. HMGB1 binds to DNA, facilitating numerous nuclear functions including maintenance of genome stability, transcription, and repair. However, little is known about the effects of nuclear HMGB1 on Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. The aim of this study was to examine whether nuclear HMGB1 plays a role in the development of Cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. Methods and results Analysis of human biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry showed decreased nuclear HMGB1 expression in failing hearts compared with normal hearts.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We demonstrated that nuclear HMGB1 was decreased in association with human heart failure and preserved amounts of nuclear HMGB1 could prevent cardiac hypertrophy and improve survival in a pressure overload heart failure model

The role of Evodiamine in human breast cancer cells.


## Human Abstract:
The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer agents, has been considered as a new strategy for anti-cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrated that Evodiamine, a quinolone alkaloid isolated from the fruit of Evodia fructus, induced apoptosis and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we found that Evodiamine significantly reduced the protein levels of Mcl-1 in 253J and T24 bladder cancer cells, and overexpression of this molecule attenuated the apoptosis induced by Evodiamine alone, or in combination with TRAIL.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we herein demonstrate for the first time that Evodiamine induces apoptosis and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells, possibly through mTOR/S6K1-mediated downregulation of Mcl-1. Therefore, our studies highlight a potential novel strategy to use Evodiamine as an adjuvant of TRAIL-based intravesical therapy for bladder cancer

The role of diabetes in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objective: Coronary artery disease is characterized by atherosclerosis in the vessel wall. Recently, it has been thought that increasing LDL-binding capacity of subendothelial proteoglycan fragments that are formed by protease activity can be responsible for the initiation of atherosclerosis. ADAMTS4 is a member of the versican-degrading proteinases. In vitro studies demonstrated that TGFβ inhibits the expression of ADAMTS4 in macrophages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and association between TGFβ1 and ADAMTS4 in Coronary artery disease. Methods: A total of 84 cases with atheroma plaque and 72 controls without plaque were analyzed.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study demonstrated that ADAMTS4 may have a critical role in atherogenesis. Determining the secondary signal that regulates ADAMTS4 expression is necessary for preventive treatment in CAD. Our data first showed clinically based findings about the association between TGFβ1 and ADAMTS4 for the progression of atherosclerosis, and the mechanism of disease is associated with atherosclerosis in diabetics. These results suggested that the TGFβ1 signaling pathway and ADAMTS4 have an important role for the progression of atherogenesis

Effect of Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D on Risk for type 2 diabetes May Be Partially Mediated by Subclinical inflammation
## Entities:
type; diabetes; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; Vitamin D; inflammation
## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (PTH) on risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We examined 25 (OH) D), serum vitamin D levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and inflammatory markers (DPN). RESULTS In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine the effects of vitamin D on the incidence of Be in a cohort of patients. Emerging evidence indicates that the coexistence of Vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (FPG).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our findings suggest that vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of Be in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of PTH on the incidence of Be in the pathogenesis of T2DM.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and incident type 2 diabetes and to determine whether the association is mediated by subclinical inflammation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using a case-cohort design, baseline levels of 25-OHD were measured in 416 case subjects with incident type 2 diabetes and 1,267 noncase subjects selected from a source population of 7,936 middle-aged participants in the population-based Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) /Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study. RESULTS A significant inverse association was observed between serum 25-OHD and incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for diabetes risk factors and season.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study demonstrated an independent association between serum 25-OHD and incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for “ classic ” diabetes risk factors. Further adjustment for markers of inflammation attenuated the HRs for the upper tertile of 25-OHD by 16–18% , suggesting that the relationship between 25-OHD and type 2 diabetes risk may be partially mediated by subclinical inflammation. Stratified analyses demonstrated a significant association between 25-OHD and type 2 diabetes in younger (presumably mainly premenopausal) women, but not in older (most likely postmenopausal) women. Our results are in line with three other prospective studies reporting inverse associations between 25-OHD and incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for “ classic ” diabetes risk factors (1, 2, 4, 5

Hyperinsulinemia and sulfonylurea use are independently associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with suboptimal blood glucose control
## Entities:
diabetes; glucose; Hyperinsulinemia; diabetes mellitus; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; sulfonylurea; type 2 diabetes mellitus
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Hyperinsulinemia and sulfonylurea (T2DM) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between DM and new-onset blood glucose (FPG) and insulin resistance (HOMA). Patients were divided into two groups: control group (n = 44), and the controls (mean age, n=21). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between these variables and the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study showed that DM and T2DM in patients with type 2 diabetes was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The association between Hyperinsulinemia and sulfonylurea levels were found to be independent predictors of insulin resistance. These findings are important to confirm the relationship between these variables in the pathogenesis of CVD.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objective Although diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the underlying mechanisms leading to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) remain poorly understood. The study was designed to assess the risk factors for LVDD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Research design and methods The study cohort included 101 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without overt heart disease. Left ventricular diastolic function was estimated as the ratio of early diastolic velocity (E) from transmitral inflow to early diastolic velocity (e ’) of tissue Doppler at mitral annulus (E/e ’).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In the present study, we showed that E/e ’ significantly correlated with fasting insulin concentration, as well as with sulfonylurea use, age, and sex. Our findings confirm previous results, showing that the prevalence of LVDD was higher in women 11 and was associated with age. 11 12 Although hypertension is also a well-known risk factor for LVDD, 3 it was not associated with E/e ’ in multivariate linear regression analysis. The reason may be that the patients enrolled in this study were currently controlled with antihypertensive medications.

## System Abstract:
Introduction We report a case of a patient with pulmonary involvement, who developed Chronic granulomatous disease (PS) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (PE). Case presentation A 60-year-old man presented with sudden onset of left upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. He had a history of right lower extremity weakness, accompanied by edema, myalgia, and autonomic instability. He was diagnosed with bone marrow. He had a typical diagnosis of pneumonitis. He had an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
We report a rare case of a patient with pulmonary involvement of PS and PE in patients with bone marrow. Early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonitis, especially in the absence of GPA. Although the clinical course of this condition, it is important to recognize the possibility of suspicion for treating IOP. However, clinicians should be aware of the importance of this complication.

Efficacy and safety of granuloma in the treatment of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Chronic granulomatous disease, one of the primary immunodeficiency syndromes, is characterized by failure of phagocytic capacity due to loss of reactive oxygen species production, as well as formation of granulomas in organs. Clinically, dysregulated inflammation by excessive cytokine production due to loss of reactive oxygen species production is suggested as a cause of noninfectious inflammatory problems such as chronic granulomatous disease colitis. We experienced a rare case of a patient with chronic granulomatous disease with unique pathological and radiological presentations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, which to our knowledge has never been previously reported. Case presentation A 20-year-old Japanese man with chronic granulomatous disease was referred due to cough and abnormal chest imaging findings.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
When we encounter a case of hypersensitive pneumonitis showing atypical pulmonary mass-like opacities in a patient with CGD, we should consider hyperinflammatory status and excessive granuloma formation of CGD and start with high-dose steroid therapy as treatment

Relative risk of Diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and the Metabolic syndrome in people with severe mental illnesses: Systematic review and metaanalysis
## Entities:
metabolic syndrome; diabetes; Diabetes; Metabolic syndrome; hypertension
## System Abstract:
Background Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of dyslipidaemia and to examine the association between the use of hypertension and the Metabolic syndrome (DM) and to compare the relative risks of severe mental status in people with chronic diseases. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the references were conducted to assess the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the prevalence of hypertension and mental status in people with chronic diseases and the relative risk of dyslipidaemia in patients with T2DM. The findings of this study showed that the use of DM and the association between the Metabolic syndrome was associated with the severity of CVD and the risks of cardiovascular disease. The correlation between BMI and the duration of the MetS was found to be an independent predictor for the management of CKD, but not only in the general population. There are no conflicts of interest.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Severe mental illnesses (SMI) may be independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors and the Metabolic syndrome. We aimed to systematically assess studies that compared Diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and Metabolic syndrome in people with and without SMI. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL & PsycINFO. We hand searched reference lists of key articles. We employed three search main themes: SMI, cardiovascular disease, and each cardiovascular risk factor. We selected cross-sectional, case control, cohort or intervention studies comparing one or more risk factor in both SMI and a reference group.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our findings emphasise the importance of poor physical health outcomes in people with SMI, including adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, we have highlighted gaps in our current knowledge base. This review suggests that diabetes is indeed more common in SMI. Metabolic syndrome may also be more common, while there is far weaker evidence regarding dyslipidaemia and hypertension. We require high quality studies in representative samples of people with SMI in which all participants have been screened for cardiovascular risk. These should be cross-referenced to contemporary comparison data regarding the incidence of risk factors in the general population.

FTY720 postconditions isolated perfused heart by a mechanism independent of sphingosine kinase 2 and different from S1P or ischemic postconditioning
## Entities:
Sph; ischemic; S1P; FTY720; sphingosine
## System Abstract:
Background: FTY720 is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of sphingosine on the incidence of S1P in patients with ischemic heart disease (PD). Methods A total of 94 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 7), and 128 days. The primary endpoint was the first observation of the left anterior descending aorta and the presence of a diagnosis of the myocardium.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that sphingosine on the incidence of S1P in patients with ischemic heart disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.
## System New Title:
Association of sphingosine in patients with Sph: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background We investigated the hypothesis that postconditioning by FTY720 (FTY) in isolated perfused mouse hearts is independent of the sphingosine 1-phoSphate (S1P) pathway. Material/Methods Ex vivo hearts were exposed to postconditioning (POST) by either ischemia or FTY720. Protection against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury was measured by recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and infarct size. Results FTY effectively postconditioned (POST) ex vivo hearts against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury as measured by recovery of LVDP and a low infarct size. FTY protection, unlike S1P but like sphingosine (Sph), was insensitive to inhibition of S1P G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) or inhibition of PI3
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our data reveal that FTY720 effectively postconditions the ex vivo heart and does so by the same mechanism as Sphingosine. Studies of SphK2 KO hearts further revealed that this occurs even in the absence of capacity for FTY720 phoSphorylation, which indicates that POST is unrelated to FTY720-phoSphate. Based on existing data, it appears that in vivo FTY720 can be expected to exhibit a mix of S1P and Sphingosine like effects with the latter being more effective in aging hearts

## System Abstract:
Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for gestational diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of endothelial dysfunction in relation to the development of carbohydrate metabolism in pregnancy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 32 subjects (mean age 58 years) were recruited and divided into three groups: control group (n = 20), and type 2 diabetic controls. Blood samples were collected before and after the onset of the disease. Results. The results showed that the curve of the differentially expressed in the ratio of the lower limbs (P < 0. 001) and the lowest (95% confidence interval [ CI ].

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background History of gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM) identifies a very young population of females predisposed for type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction might represent a shared precursor of both disorders. Hence, this study aimed to characterize endothelial biomarkers in relation to impaired insulin sensitivity and progression to overt Diabetes early after index pregnancy. Methods 108 women with previous GDM and 40 controls were included three to six months after delivery and underwent specific metabolic assessments including a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and an oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes progression was assessed in females with pGDM over 10 years of follow-up.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we found that Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction are related to impaired insulin sensitivity and moreover notably increased in females with recent history of GDM. Thereby sICAM-1 and sE-selectin tended to be elevated in subjects who showed a progression to type 2 diabetes after delivery and hence possibly indicate the later development of overt cardiometabolic disorders in this relatively young aged risk population. Follow-up examinations with clearly defined cardiovascular endpoints as well as randomized trials are necessary to further examine clinical consequences and possible therapeutic approaches. However, our results indicate a need of early risk stratification immediately after delivery.

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the Substrate characteristics and the role of arrhythmogenic factors in patients with Idiopathic Ventricular Outflow Tract (EAC). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all cases of tachycardia and incidentally collected from January 2009 to June 2013. All the first time, the interaction between the groups were evaluated. Results The results showed that the presence of precancerous lesions (p < 0. 001) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were compared to the control group (n = 14).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study showed that the Substrate characteristics of precancerous lesions in patients with Idiopathic Ventricular Outflow Tract (EAC %) was found to be a prognostic factor for the treatment of tachycardia. However, it is important to consider the role of arrhythmogenic factors in the pathogenesis of the disease.

The Role of tachycardia in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the different substrate characteristics of repetitive premature ventricular complexed (PVC) trigger sites by the non-contact mapping (NCM). Methods Thirty-five consecutive patients, including 14 with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC) and 21 with idiopathic right Ventricular Outflow tract Tachycardia (RVOT VT), were enrolled for electrophysiological study and catheter ablation guided by the NCM. Substrate and electrogram (Eg) characteristics of the earliest activation (EA) and breakout (BO) sites of PVCs were investigated, and these were confirmed by successful PVC elimination.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The result of our study supports the conclusions of previous studies that ARVC and RVOT tachycardia are fundamentally different entities that can usually be distinguished. The substrate characteristics of PVC trigger may help to differentiate between idiopathic RVOT VT and ARVC. The slowing and slurred QS unipolar Eg and longer distance from EA to BO in RVOT endocardium suggest that the triggers of ARVC may originate from mid- or sub-epicardial myocardium. More extensive ablation to the trigger site was required in order to create deeper lesions for a successful outcome in ARVC group

## System Abstract:
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MMP-7, KL-6, and SP-D on the quality of life (QoL). Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, observational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, open-label, controlled clinical trial. From October 2009 to May 2016, we investigated the influence of Circulating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (II) and CCL18 in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CAD). The primary endpoint was the standard of care, anxiety, and severity of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of the present study showed that MMP-7, KL-6, and SP-D in the treatment of patients with CAD. However, the effect of II and CCL18 on the quality of life and QoL are not associated with the severity of the disease.

## Human Abstract:
Background. Recent reports indicate that matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) are potential disease markers of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The objective of this study was to perform direct comparisons of these two biomarkers with three well-investigated serum markers of IPF, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), surfactant protein-A (SP-A), and SP-D. Methods. The serum levels of MMP-7, CCL18, KL-6, SP-A, and SP-D were evaluated in 65 patients with IPF, 31 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 101 healthy controls.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results showed that both MMP-7 and KL-6 might be a useful prognostic marker of IPF, and a combination of the two markers may improve survival prediction in patients with IPF. Additionally, we showed that MMP-7 and KL-6 could differentiate IPF patients from patients with bacterial pneumonia and healthy controls. These results indicate that the measurement of serum levels of KL-6 and/or MMP-7 could potentially support the diagnosis of IPF and would be useful for identifying vulnerable patients especially when the two markers are used in combination. Further large-scale investigation would be warranted to confirm this finding and to find the best method to use this combination of biomarkers of IPF

## System Abstract:
Background metformin is one of the most common type of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Hypoxia on Endothelial function and angiogenesis. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 patients were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 10), and a high-fat diet (HFD). Blood glucose was measured by MTT assay and Western blot analysis. Results showed that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) decreases the expression of Bcl-2 and its downstream signaling pathways.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that Hypoxia of Bcl-2 and HIF-1α may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metformin.

## Human Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity/mortality worldwide. metformin is the first therapy offering cardioprotection in type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic animals with unknown mechanism. We have shown that metformin improves angiogenesis via affecting expression of growth factors/angiogenic inhibitors in CD34 + cells under hyperglycemia-hypoxia. Now we studied the direct effect of physiological dose of metformin on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) under conditions mimicking hypoxia-hyperglycemia. HUVEC migration and apoptosis were studied after induction with euglycemia or hyperglycemia and/or CoCl 2 induced hypoxia in the presence or absence of metformin. HUVEC mRNA was assayed by whole transcript microarrays.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our in vitro study demonstrates that the effect of metformin in acute Hyperglycemia-chemical hypoxia model is mediated through restoring VEGFA pathway. This occurs through upregulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, leading to dual effect on activation of cell migration through MMP16 and ROCK1 upregulation, in addition to inhibition of apoptosis by increase in phospho-ERK1/2 and FABP4, components of VEGF signaling cascades

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between heart failure and cardiometabolic complications (CVD) risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of 202 obese subjects (n = 502) and the control group (NGT). Each subject was used to determine the association between peak HbA 1c (FPG) and increased levels of metabolic parameters (P < 0. 05). Results The mean age of the body mass index (BMI), a 2-h OGTT, was significantly higher in the presence of DM.

Association between obesity and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Although many obese individuals are normoglycemic and asymptomatic of cardiometabolic complications, this apparent healthy state may be a misnomer. Since heart failure is a major cause of mortality in obesity, we investigated the effects of heme-oxygenase (HO) on heart failure and cardiometabolic complications in obese normoglycemic Zucker-fatty rats (ZFs). Treatment with the HO-inducer, hemin, reduced markers of heart failure, such as osteopontin and osteoprotegerin, abated left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy/fibrosis, extracellular matrix/profibrotic proteins including collagen IV, fibronectin, TGF- β 1, and reduced cardiac lesions. Furthermore, hemin suppressed inflammation by abating macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha, TNF- α, IL-6, and IL-1 β but enhanced adiponectin, atrial-natriuretic peptide (ANP), HO activity, insulin sensitivity, and glucose
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The novelty of our study includes: (i) the hemin-induced selective enhancement of the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in left-ventricular tissue of ZFs and parallel reduction of the proinflammatory macrophage M1 phenotype and MIP-1 α, a chemokine implicated in macrophage infiltration; (ii) the hemin-dependent suppression of heart failure proteins such as osteopontin and osteoprotegerin; (iii) the suppression of inflammatory cytokines in ZFs; and (iv) the hemin-induced reduction of insulin resistance and improvement of cardiac function in ZFs. Since we recently reported that the HO system suppressed pericardial adiposity in a model characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, and overt hyperglycemia [ 13 ], and the present study indicates that hemin therapy abates cardiac inflammation in obesity, an interorgan crosstalk of inflammatory mediators between the myocardium and pericardial adipose tissue can be envisaged in the pathophysiology of diabetic

## System Abstract:
Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common cause of disability in the United States. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dyslipidemia on the severity of additive and to assess the impact of sleep apnea on the increasing risk of hypercapnia. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of a random sample of patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent polysomnography (PSG) or a control group (n = 10). Participants were divided into two groups according to the International Classification of breathing (AHI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that dyslipidemia on the severity of additive and the increasing risk of hypercapnia in patients with CAD. However, it is important to consider the impact of sleep apnea on the prevention of OSA in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Current study was designed to investigate the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) combined dyslipidemia on the prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). Methods This was a cross-sectional study and subjects with documented dyslipidemia and without previous diagnosis of OSA were enrolled. Polysomnography was applied to evaluate apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Based on AHI value, subjects were classified into four groups: without OSA, mild, moderate and severe OSA groups. Clinical characteristics and laboratory examination data were recorded. Relationship between AHI event and lipid profiles was analyzed, and logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effects of OSA combined dyslipidemia on ASCVD prevalence.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our preliminary research showed that OSA increased ASCVD prevalence in subjects with documented dyslipidemia, and OSA plus dyslipidemia conferred additive adverse effects on cardiovascular system, with severe-OSA most prominent. In the future study, it is warranted to investigate whether improve OSA could reduce ASCVD risk associated with dyslipidemia

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE We carried out a secondary analysis in high-risk patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes in the Alpha Omega Trial. We tested the hypothesis that in these patients an increased intake of the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and α-linolenic acid (ALA) will reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythMIas and fatal MI. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A subgroup of 1,014 post-MI patients with diabetes aged 60–80 years was randomly allocated to receive one of four trial margarines, three with an additional amount of n-3 fatty acids and one placebo for 40 months.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Low-dose supplementation of n-3 fatty acids EPA-DHA plus ALA significantly reduced ventricular arrhythMIa–related events in post-MI patients with diabetes. The combined supplementation of these three fatty acids also reduced the composite end-point ventricular arrhythMIa–related events plus fatal MI but not fatal MI alone. A liMItation of the current study is the small number of patients who developed ventricular arrhythMIas (n = 29) or died of MI (n = 27). The study had enough power to detect significant effects of combined supplementation of EPA-DHA and ALA on the end-point ventricular arrhythMIa–related events whether or not in combination with fatal MI.

## System Abstract:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of apocynin (GB) on the myocardium and its role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Twenty-two Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n = 44), and fractional exhaled infiltration (IR). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with cardiac injury treated with the addition of the treatment. The results showed that the inhibition of SOD was significantly reduced by decreasing cytosolic inhibitory activity against heart rate (95% confidence interval [ CI ]).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results indicate that GB on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the inhibition of SOD was observed in the treatment of T2DM. This study has shown that the effect of apocynin on the myocardium and its role in the regulation of heart rate and the activation of the addition of the IR. This finding may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of cardiac injury. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the balance between these effects.

## Human Abstract:
Background Type 4 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) refers to the cardiac injury induced by chronic kidney disease. We aimed to assess oxidative stress and cardiac injury in patients with type 4 CRS, determine whether the antioxidant apocynin attenuated cardiac injury in rats with type 4 CRS, and explore potential mechanisms. Methods and Results A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with type 4 CRS (n=17) and controls (n=16). Compared with controls, patients with type 4 CRS showed elevated oxidative stress, which was significantly correlated with cardiac hypertrophy and decreased ejection fraction. In vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy and sham surgery, followed with apocynin or vehicle treatment for 8
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in cardiac injury accompanied by CKD. Increased oxidative stress was significantly linked to the cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in patients with type 4 CRS. Our results showed, for the first time, that Apocynin attenuated cardiac injury in type 4 CRS. The mechanism may be through inhibition of NOX-dependent oxidative stress-activated ERK1/2 pathway and subsequent FGF-2 upregulation. The present study added evidence to the cardioprotective effects of antioxidant treatment and underlined the involvement of FGF-2 in type 4 CRS. Given the high morbidity and mortality of this syndrome, and the controversy on antioxidant treatment in cardiovascular diseases, more studies are needed to assess the roles of oxidative stress and the effect of different antioxidants in type 4 CRS as well as other

## Human Abstract:
Background Phenylketonuria is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism which can cause severe damage to the patient or, in the case of Maternal Phenylketonuria, to the foetus. The Maternal Phenylketonuria syndrome is caused by high blood phenylalanine concentrations during pregnancy and presents with serious foetal anomalies, especially congenital heart disease, microcephaly and mental retardation. Case presentation We report on an affected Albanian woman and her seven children. The mother is affected by Phenylketonuria and is a compound heterozygote for two pathogenetic mutations, L48S and P281L. The diagnosis was only made in the context of her children, all of whom have at least one severe organic malformation.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The case histories of the patients reported here provide further information on the maternal PKU syndrome, which causes heart malformation, microcephaly, mental retardation and stunted growth, respectively [ Koch et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Levy et al., 2001; Rouse et al., 1997 ], since it is the largest family suffering from maternal PKU reported in the literature. There are several reports of undiagnosed maternal PKU in the English language literature [ Starostecka et al., 2001; Hanley et al., 1999 ], however, none with as many as 7 offspring.

## System Abstract:
Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Abstract Background hypothermia (TBI) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the provision of platelet aggregation and may reduce mortality in patients with clopidogrel. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective, observational, randomized, controlled trial, placed in the United States treated with catheterization. All participants were randomly assigned to four groups: control group (n = 7) and normothermia (HC).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The present study showed that the provision of platelet aggregation in patients with clopidogrel and may be associated with increased risk of mortality in TBI. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Mild hypothermia is currently standard of care for cardiac arrest patients in many hospitals and a common belief is that hypothermia attenuates platelet aggregation. We wanted to examine the effects of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation during hypothermia. Methods Platelet reactivity at 37°C and 33°C was evaluated by light transmission aggregometry and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in blood from healthy volunteers before, and 24 hours after, a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel. Results Collagen, 5-HT, epinephrine, U46619 and ADP-induced platelet aggregation was unaltered or even increased by hypothermia. After clopidogrel, there was a significant increase in platelet aggregation for 5 and 20 μM ADP at 33°C compared to 37°C (46 ± 5 vs. 34 ± 5% and 58 ± 4 vs. 47 ± 4% , p < 0.001, n = 8
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study indicates that platelet reactivity is unaltered and in some situations increased during mild Hypothermia. The inhibitory effect of clopidogrel was attenuated in our study. The clinical conclusion is that we cannot rely on Hypothermia per se as a platelet inhibitor. Based on current ex vivo evidence, dual platelet inhibition with aspirin and clopidogrel is probably needed for patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with mild Hypothermia. Since Hypothermia induces a state of reduced clopidogrel responsiveness, it is possible that new reversible ADP blockers such as AZD6140 could be beneficial.

Age, gender, insulin and blood glucose control status alter the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke among elderly diabetic patients
## Entities:
glucose; diabetic; blood glucose; insulin; stroke; ischemic heart disease
## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ischemic heart disease and stroke in elderly diabetic patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: A total of 79 obese subjects aged ≥ 65 years of age, sex, and diabetes mellitus (DM) were included in the absence of Stroke. The primary endpoint was the proportion of arterial blood pressure (BP), insulin, and lifestyle factors. Results: The mean difference was associated with increased risk of falls and decreased mortality.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that ischemic heart disease and stroke in elderly diabetic patients is not associated with increased risk of falls. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background We analyzed the effects of insulin therapy, age and gender on the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) according to glycemic control. Methods and Results We performed a prospective cohort study (Japan Cholesterol and Diabetes Mellitus Study) of type 2 diabetes patients (n = 4014) for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the onset of fatal/non-fatal IHD and/or CVA, which occurred at rates of 7.9 and 7.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. We divided diabetic patients into four groups based on age (≤ 70 and 70) and hemoglobin A1C levels (≤ 7.0 and 7.0 %).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study suggests that the risk factors for IHD and CVA in diabetic individuals change with age and gender and perhaps with a patient's degree of glycemic control. insulin use has a potential role in preventing IHD but may also be a risk factor for CVA among the diabetic elderly. Therefore, although the treatment of diabetes is obviously important, insulin therapy for glycemic control should be carefully considered in those elderly patients. Treatment modalities that reduce the adverse effects of insulin without sacrificing its glycemic controlling effects would be of particular interest in the treatment of elderly diabetic individuals

## System Abstract:
Background type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum Adiposity and thickness (IMT) in men and healthy individuals. Material/Methods We examined the correlations between Visceral and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the presence and absence of insulin resistance in the control group. We performed a retrospective study of the patients with newly diagnosed T1D (n = 14) and normal controls (mean age: < 85 years).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that serum Adiposity and IMT levels are associated with increased risk of insulin resistance in the presence of CVD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Aim: Visceral fat accumulation is known to underlie the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not completely understood how visceral fat accumulation influences the development of cardiovascular disease. In this study, we investigated the clinical impact of visceral adiposity on vascular stiffness and thickness in patients with type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Methods: One hundred and sixty-one patients with T2D, including 92 men and 69 women, were included in this cross-sectional study. Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were measured by dual bioelectrical impedance analysis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study demonstrates that visceral adiposity is independently associated with stiffness parameter β of the carotid artery in men with T2D. Our data may indicate that the accumulated visceral fat preferentially affects arterial stiffness, known as an independent predictor of CVD. Further studies are required to identify the factors linking visceral fat accumulation and arterial stiffening in diabetes. In addition, interventional studies are warranted to clarify whether reduction of visceral adiposity could reverse arterial stiffness, a functional change of the arterial wall, in patients with diabetes at a high risk of CVDs

## System Abstract:
Obesity is a major health problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of naringin on diet-induced obesity and lipid metabolism. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 14). Rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. At the same period, the animals were randomly assigned to a single dose of 0. 5 mg/kg body weight (ad libitum daily). Blood glucose tolerance tests were used to ascertain the underlying mechanisms.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that naringin on diet-induced obesity and lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in rats. These findings suggest that the effects of these drugs could be beneficial for the treatment of Obesity.

## Human Abstract:
obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and fatty liver, together termed metabolic syndrome, are key risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Chronic feeding of a diet high in saturated fats and simple sugars, such as fructose and glucose, induces these changes in rats. Naturally occurring compounds could be a cost-effective intervention to reverse these changes. Flavonoids are ubiquitous secondary plant metabolites; naringin gives the bitter taste to grapefruit. This study has evaluated the effect of naringin on diet-induced obesity and cardiovascular dysfunction in high carbohydrate, high fat-fed rats. These rats developed increased body weight, glucose intolerance, increased plasma lipid concentrations, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, liver inflammation and steatosis with compromised mitochondrial respiratory chain
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Naringin was effective against the symptoms of metabolic syndrome in a diet-induced obese rat model. Naringin decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, lowered plasma lipids, improved oxidative stress and mitochondrial function as the probable mechanisms to reverse metabolic syndrome. Thus, citrus flavonoids, such as Naringin, can be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of metabolic syndrome; clinical trials are required to establish the safety of these natural compounds

## System Abstract:
Background Ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (MMPs) has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM). However, little is known about the effects of Fibrosis on cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Methods We used wild-type (STZ −/−) mice (n = 106) and normal hearts. The primary outcome was established by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (CAC), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (LV) fibroblasts, collagen, and interleukin (IL) -1β.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the present study demonstrated that Fibrosis could suppress cardiac remodeling and apoptosis in mice. Our findings suggest that MMPs may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes.

## Human Abstract:
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) is a cell cycle checkpoint protein activated in response to DNA damage. We recently reported that ATM plays a protective role in myocardial remodeling following β-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Here we investigated the role of ATM in cardiac remodeling using myocardial Infarction (MI) as a model. Methods and Results: Left ventricular (LV) structure, function, apoptosis, fibrosis, and protein levels of apoptosis- and fibrosis-related proteins were examined in wild-type (WT) and ATM heterozygous knockout (hKO) mice 7 days post-MI. Infarct sizes were similar in both MI groups.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The data presented here provide evidence that ATM has the potential to modulate infarct tissue dynamics. It alters the infarct structure by affecting apoptosis, fibrosis, and expression of α-SMA. It should be emphasized that our data on investigating the role of ATM in myocardial remodeling post-MI are obtained 7 days post-MI. Changes in the size and thickness of infarct scar can eventually affect infarct expansion and contribute to the diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, it is possible that increased fibrosis (stiffness) and apoptosis (in the border area) in ATM deficient mice may associate with earlier diastolic dysfunction if the study time points are extended beyond 7 days post-MI.

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Fluvastatin in patients with acute coronary syndrome (CAD). Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of statins in the treatment of ACS in the first-line therapy. The primary endpoint was the first time, and the clinical outcome of the disease was evaluated. Results The mean age of 12 months was compared with the end of the left anterior descending coronary artery (TG) and a median washout period (range of 95% confidence intervals [ HR ], P < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of the present study showed that statins of Fluvastatin in patients with CAD in the first-line therapy of ACS in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. The combination of the efficacy was effective in reducing the incidence of the disease. However, it may be useful as a therapeutic option for the management of the clinical outcome. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background statins have been proved to be effective in reduction of mortality and morbidity when started in the early secondary prevention in stabilized patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The safety and efficacy of statin administration directly in the first-line therapy in unstable ACS patients is not clear. The aim of our study was, therefore, to assess the effect of statin treatment initiated immediately at hospital admission of patients with ACS. Methods The trial was stopped prematurely after enrollment of one hundred and fifty-six patients with ACS that were randomized at admission to Fluvastatin 80 mg (N = 78) or placebo (N = 78).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Up to the best knowledge the FACS trial (fluvastatin in the therapy of acute coronary syndrome) is the first randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study focused on the effects of statin administration in the first-line therapy of acute coronary syndrome. We have shown that in ACS patients treated with early invasive strategy and according to the current recommendations for pharmacological interventions, fluvastatin therapy started at admission does not influence serum markers of inflammation and plaque instability, however, it is safe and may improve clinical outcomes in these patients

## Human Abstract:
trimetazidine is a cytoprotective drug whose cardiovascular effectiveness, especially in patients with stable ischemic heart disease, has been the source of much controversy in recent years; some have gone so far as to treat the medication as a ‘ placebo drug ’ whose new side effects, such as Parkinsonian symptoms, outweigh its benefits. This article is an attempt to present the recent key studies, including meta-analyses, on the use of trimetazidine in chronic heart failure, also in patients with diabetes mellitus and arrhythmia, as well as in peripheral artery disease. This paper also includes the most recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines, including those of 2013, on the use of trimetazidine in cardiovascular
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The most documented effect of Trimetazidine has been in stable coronary artery disease, which has been demonstrated by inclusion of this drug into the recommendations, as well as in both diabetic and ischaemic CHF, which still requires confirmation in large clinical studies. There are still no answers to key questions as to the role of this drug in selected cardiovascular conditions as well as whether this drug can reduce mortality in any group of patients with cardiovascular disease [ 68 – 72 ]

## Human Abstract:
Tamoxifen (Tam), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is in wide clinical use for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. High Tam doses have been used for treatment of gliomas and cancers with multiple drug resistance, but long QT Syndrome is a side effect. Tam is also used experimentally in mice for inducible gene knockout in numerous tissues, including heart; however, the potential direct effects of Tam on cardiac myocyte mechanical function are not known. The goal of this study was to determine the direct, acute effects of Tam, its active metabolite 4-hydroxyTamoxifen (4OHT), and related drug raloxifene (Ral) on isolated rat cardiac myocyte mechanical function and calcium
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the goal of the present study was to determine the effects of Tam, 4OHT, and Ral on mechanical function of cardiac myocytes. Of primary importance is the potential implications these results have both for patients taking high doses of Tam and for prudent utilization of Tam in the Tg (αMHC-MerCreMer) mouse model. We found significant deviations in contractile performance and Ca 2+ handling resulting from acute treatment of cardiac myocytes with Tam, 4OHT, and Ral. Effects were seen primarily with 5-10 µM Tam and 4OHT, and 3-10 µM Ral.

## Human Abstract:
An environmentally benign and efficient hydrothermal reduction method was applied for the preparation of three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene Hydrogel (GH) adsorbents. The physicochemical properties of GH granules were systematically characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. GH granules showed an excellent adsorption capacity (235.6 mg/g) for ciprofloxacin via combined adsorption interaction mechanisms (e.g. π-π EDA interaction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interaction). Moreover, reducing the size of the Hydrogels can significantly accelerate the adsorption process and enhance the removal efficiency of pollutants from aqueous solution.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this work, we have demonstrated a facile solution processable method for the synthesis of 3D porous graphene Hydrogels using ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. The resulting GH granules were used as efficient adsorbents for Ciprofloxacin removal in aqueous solutions. Collective experimental data showed that GH granules exhibited excellent Ciprofloxacin adsorption capacity of 235.6 mg, which can be attributed to multiple adsorption interaction mechanisms (e.g. π-π EDA interaction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction) between Hydrogel and Ciprofloxacin. Reduction of Hydrogel sizes enables to accelerate the adsorption process and thus enhance the removal efficiency of pollutants.

## Human Abstract:
Introduction and background Patients with chronic lung diseases frequently have depressive and Anxiety symptoms, but there are very few studies looking at this in patients with bronchiectasis. Aim This study aimed to investigate Depression and Anxiety and related factors among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Patients and methods This was a prospective study of 133 patients with bronchiectasis. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of bronchiectasis with high-resolution computed tomography were enrolled in the study. Patients that were clinically stable in the previous 4 weeks were evaluated with the Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale. Symptoms, pulmonary function tests, and medical treatments were recorded.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis are at increased risk for Anxiety and Depression. Admission to an emergency department within the last year and living with a partner were related to Depression and Anxiety. Also, hemoptysis was correlated with Depression, and education level, previous Depression history was associated to Anxiety. Untreated and undetected depressive and Anxiety symptoms may increase physical disability, morbidity, and health care utilization. Future research is needed to address the impact, early detection, and management of Anxiety and Depression from bronchiectasis

Objective To show non-inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin for the treatment of severe infections due to meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Design Parallel, open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Four acute care hospitals in Israel. Participants Adults with severe infections caused by MRSA susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Patients with left sided endocarditis, meningitis, chronic haemodialysis, and prolonged neutropenia were excluded. Interventions trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily versus vancomycin 1 g twice daily for a minimum of seven days and then by indication. Main outcome measures The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure assessed at day 7, consisting of death, persistence of haemodynamic instability or fever, stable or worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and persistence of
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority compared with vancomycin among patients with invasive MRSA infections. In the subgroup of patients with bacteraemia, the difference in treatment failure and all cause mortality might be clinically important. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for the treatment of severe MRSA infections. We propose a further randomised controlled trial to examine the feasibility of step-down from vancomycin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, allowing early discharge of patients with MRSA responding to treatment. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has excellent coverage against meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in most locations worldwide vancomycin is inferior to β lactams for meticillin susceptible S aureus and might be losing effectiveness against MRSA owing to minimum inhibitory concentration “ creep ” No contemporary randomised controlled trials have compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with vancomycin in the treatment of severe MRSA infections In a randomised controlled trial including 252 inpatients, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority to vancomycin in the treatment of severe MRSA infections The difference was particularly marked for patients with bacteraemia Adverse events rates were similar for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

The role of dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.


## Human Abstract:
Background Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring compound, exerts powerful protective effects in various cardiovascular disease models. However, its role in protecting against diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has not been elucidated. In this study, we have investigated the effects of ALA on cardiac dysfunction, mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS), extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and interrelated signaling pathways in a diabetic rat model. Methods Diabetes was induced in rats by I.V. injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 45 mg/kg. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal groups with or without ALA treatment, and diabetes groups with or without ALA treatment.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Collectively, under STZ-induced diabetic conditions, Cardiac fibrosis is associated with increased synthesis and decreased degradation of ECM. This is accompanied by increased differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and reduced MMP-2 activity, concomitant with increased mitochondrial oxidative damage and elevated expression and activation of JNK, p38 MAPK and TGF-β. All these changes can be reversed by ALA, suggesting that ALA possesses therapeutic potential in the treatment of DCM

## Human Abstract:
Hypertensive diabetes individuals are at higher risk for cardiovascular events and progression to end stage renal disease. Several well conducted clinical trials indicate that aggressive treatment of hypertension in individual with diabetes reduces these complications. Combinations of two or more antihypertensive drugs are frequently required to reach the target blood pressure and to improve the cardiovascular and renal outcomes in these patients. There are physiological and clinical rationales for renin-angiotensin system blockade in hypertensive diabetics. trandolapril/verapamil sustained released (SR) is a fixed-dose combination of trandolapril and a sustained release formulation of verapamil and indicated in treatment of hypertension in patients who require more than one drug to reach target blood pressure.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Effective blood pressure control and ACE inhibitor therapy are both key components of cardiovascular and renoprotective treatments in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ndCCB may help achieve optimal blood pressure control while limiting the need for concomitant antihypertensive medications that may adversely affect the metabolic control and the overall cardiovascular risk profile of people with diabetes. Trandolapril/verapamil SR is an effective and well tolerated combination therapy for both patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In BENEDICT, Trandolapril alone, or Trandolapril/verapamil delayed the onset of microalbuminuria in more than 40% of patients compared with placebo in hypertensive diabetic patients.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE —That type 2 diabetes is associated with the metabolic syndrome is known. However, information is lacking regarding the long-term and adverse changes of metabolic syndrome variables in the development of type 2 diabetes from childhood to adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —Observations were examined, retrospectively, in a community-based cohort of normoglycemic (n = 1,838), pre-diabetic (n = 90), and type 2 diabetic (n = 60) subjects followed serially for cardiovascular risk factors during childhood (4–11 years), adolescence (12–18 years), and adulthood (19–44 years).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
These observations explore the natural history of impaired glucose regulation and diabetes status in a community-based population of children free from a selection bias monitored longitudinally over a period of 21 years. Data linked the conditions of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in young adults with concurrent longitudinal changes in some metabolic syndrome risk variables from childhood to young adulthood. The present population study shows that among the metabolic syndrome risk variables, in a comparison with normoglycemic subjects, glucose was consistently higher from childhood through adulthood in both pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects; LDL cholesterol, insulin, and HOMA-IR were higher in pre-diabetic subjects since adolescence; and obesity, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR were higher and HDL cholesterol was lower in diabetic subjects beginning in

## Human Abstract:
Background The influence of diabetes mellitus on myocardial ischemic preconditioning is not clearly defined. Experimental studies are conflicting and human studies are scarce and inconclusive. Objectives Identify whether diabetes mellitus intervenes on ischemic preconditioning in symptomatic coronary artery disease patients. Methods Symptomatic multivessel coronary artery disease patients with preserved systolic ventricular function and a positive exercise test underwent two sequential exercise tests to demonstrate ischemic preconditioning. ischemic parameters were compared among patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. ischemic preconditioning was considered present when the time to 1.0 mm ST deviation and rate pressure-product were greater in the second of 2 exercise tests.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, diabetes mellitus did not substantially affect myocardial IP in symptomatic CAD patients. Furthermore, diabetic patients experienced an improvement in this significant mechanism of myocardial protection

Role of NT-proBNP in detection of myocardial damage in childhood leukemia survivors treated with and without anthracyclines
## Entities:
anthracyclines; anthracycline; myocardial damage; childhood leukemia; NT-proBNP
## System Abstract:
Background NT-proBNP is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of myocardial damage amongst patients with childhood leukemia survivors with and without anthracyclines. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the Department of Medicine Hospital in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Blood samples were collected from the first time of age, gender, and clinical outcome. Results. Grade 1 (n = 104) had significantly higher levels of serum leptin (P < 0. 01) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that patients with childhood leukemia survivors with anthracyclines is associated with increased serum leptin levels and mortality. However, the prognostic value of myocardial damage was found to be an independent risk factor for the treatment of NT-proBNP. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Exposure to anthracyclines (ANT) during childhood represents a high risk for development of late cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity is usually detected only when clinical symptoms or progressive cardiac dysfunction have already occurred. Early detection of cardiotoxicity may lead to better therapeutic outcome. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) has been hypothesized to reflect increased left ventricular wall stress before development of echocardiographic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to detect cardiac abnormalities using plasma NTproBNP and echocardiography in asymptomatic childhood leukemia survivors treated with or without cardiotoxic anthracycline therapy. Methods Serum levels of NTproBNP were determined in 69 asymptomatic survivors of childhood leukemia treated with or without anthracyclines and in 44 apparently healthy
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Higher levels of NTproBNP detected in childhood leukemia survivors after low anthracycline cumulative doses might reflect an initial stage of ANT cardiotoxicity before the development of echocardiographic abnormalities. Although the current studies support NTproBNP as one of the best available biochemical markers of late anthracycline cardiotoxicity, a possible strategy toward further improvement and combination with other cardiac biomarkers and novel echocardiographic methods should be explored in additional studies

## Human Abstract:
Background Based on Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, we considered acute Kidney Injury (AKI) as an absolute increase in the serum creatinine (sCr) level of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl or 50% . The introduction of Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (UNGAL) has conferred earlier diagnosis of AKI. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, can suppress the production of some factors of inflammatory response and presumably prevent AKI. We examined the PTX on the development of AKI in cardiac surgery patients by measuring the levels of UNGAL.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we show that UNGAL has a weak correlation with sCr after cardiac surgery. PTX reduces the rise of UNGAL although not significantly. PTX may have some effect on preventing AKI as determined by attenuation of creatinine rise. In our study, PTX did not increase the risk of bleeding and caused no hemodynamic instability. We suggest future larger studies to show the effect of PTX to prevent end organ damages such as AKI after cardiopulmonary bypass. More clinical trials are needed to fully determine the different aspects of administrating PTX such as standard doses, duration of infusion and its long-term effect on mortality and morbidity

## System Abstract:
The pathogenesis of Thyroid hormones (antioxidant) is a major contributor to oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to highlight the protective role of heme (PNP) in the atherosclerotic process of Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Twenty-nine rat models were used to determine the antioxidative activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidases (GPx). The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by esterification and HPLC method. Results: Wild-type (WT) mice were assigned to the two groups: Control group (94 %).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the present study showed that PNP levels of antioxidant and CAT in the atherosclerotic process of CVD in the pathogenesis of Cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest that MDA may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes.

The Relationship between antioxidant and Oxidative Stress in Rats: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.


## Human Abstract:
In previous works we demonstrated an inverse correlation between plasma Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10) and Thyroid hormones; in fact, CoQ 10 levels in hyperthyroid patients were found among the lowest detected in human diseases. On the contrary, CoQ 10 is elevated in hypothyroid subjects, also in subclinical conditions, suggesting the usefulness of this index in assessing metabolic status in thyroid disorders. A Low-T3 syndrome is a condition observed in several chronic diseases: it is considered an adaptation mechanism, where there is a reduction in pro-hormone T4 conversion. Low T3-Syndrome is not usually considered to be corrected with replacement therapy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion thyroid hormones exert a key role in the modulation of antioxidant systems and OS is demonstrated both in hyper- and hypothyroidism. In the field of hypothyroidism, a debated question is the treatment of NTIS. Even if in the literature data are conflicting [ 67, 112, 113 ], our data suggest to consider NTIS as a real hypothyroidism at tissue level and not only as an adaptive response to the conditions mentioned above. In particular, CoQ 10 levels seem to be a reliable index of thyroid hormone effects; moreover, OS is a mechanism to be underlined in the physiopathology of NTIS and, again, it can reflect a condition of

## System Abstract:
Introduction Toll-like receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (HMGB1) is a major causative factor for the development of acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (MRI) and extracellular matrix (ECM) permeability. Methods We performed a prospective, observational, randomised, placebo-controlled, blinded, controlled clinical trial. Wild-type and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (CSF) levels were measured in the lung and lungs. After the first time, the administration of B 3 (TLR4) was administered intravenously on day 0, 5, and 14 days.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our findings suggest that MRI is a potential therapeutic target for the development of ALI in patients with NASH.

## Human Abstract:
Introduction Lung fibrosis, reduced lung compliance, and severe hypoxemia found in patients with acute lung injury often result in a need for the support of mechanical ventilation. High-tidal-volume mechanical ventilation can increase lung damage and fibrogeneic activity but the mechanisms regulating the interaction between high tidal volume and lung fibrosis are unclear. We hypothesized that high-tidal-volume ventilation increased pulmonary fibrosis in acute lung injury via the serine/threonine kinase-protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Methods After 5 days of bleomycin administration to simulate acute lung injury, male C57BL/6 mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were exposed to either high-tidal-volume mechanical ventilation (30 ml/kg) or low-tidal-volume mechanical ventilation (6 ml/kg) with room air for 1 to 5
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Using an in vivo bleomycin mouse model, we have found that high-tidal-volume ventilation increased pulmonary fibrosis by biochemical analysis of hydroxyproline, Masson trichrome staining of collagen, immunohistochemical staining for fibroblasts, microvascular permeability, and production of MIP-2, but not IP-10 production, which was, at least in part, dependent, on the Akt and ERK1/2 pathways (Figure 9). These data have added to the understanding of the effects of mechanical forces in lung fibrosis. In ARDS patients in the early fibroproliferative phase, the inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 may offer new treatment options.

## System Abstract:
Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Myocardial Infarction (HCC) in patients with Non-ST Segment. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the charts of the first time, the clinical characteristics of High-Risk lesions in predicting the diagnosis of infarction. We performed a retrospective analysis of a 17-year-old man with STEMI who had undergone coronary angiography (PCI). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess the relationship between the presence of the anterior segment of the left ventricular artery (MCA).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that HCC in patients with Non-ST Segment lesions in the presence of the anterior segment of infarction in the left ventricular artery (MCA). This is the first study to evaluate the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of High-Risk in a patient with STEMI.

## Human Abstract:
Assessment of left ventricular (LV) function is important for decision-making and risk stratification in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Many patients with non-ST segment elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) have substantial Infarction, but these patients often do not reveal clinical signs of instability, and they rarely fulfill criteria for acute revascularization therapy. AIM This study evaluated the potential of strain Doppler echocardiography analysis for the assessment of LV Infarct size when compared with standard two-dimensional echo and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data. METHODS Thirty patients with NSTEMI were examined using echocardiography after hospitalization for 1.8 ± 1.1 days for the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, wall motion score index (WMSI), and LV global longitudinal strain (GLS
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
GLS is a good predictor of infarct size in NSTEMI, and it may serve as a tool in conjunction with risk stratification scores for the selection of high-risk NSTEMI patients who may benefit from urgent revascularization. These findings may be of health economic interest and possess several potential clinical implications

## Human Abstract:
Introduction Accelerated atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of morbidity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is considered an early marker of atherosclerosis. It is a reversible alteration, thus representing an attractive target for prevention strategies against cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that ED occurs in patients with SLE even in the absence of severe, active disease. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used in SLE to control disease activity, but its use is also associated with an improvement in long-term prognosis. Beyond the beneficial effect in well-established disease, our hypothesis is that treatment with HCQ might have a beneficial impact on ED prevention in
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study shows that early treatment with HCQ is able to reduce early ED related to the inflammatory process in a mouse model of SLE. These data may support the clinical observations of the potential beneficial effect of HCQ in preventing vascular damage in human SLE and may support the early introduction of HCQ in patients with recent disease onset

## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of DPP-4 on cardiovascular injury in salt-sensitive (STZ) induced by blood glucose and blood pressure (BP) in rats. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was performed in a single dose of 50 mg/kg/day of 10 mg/kg body weight (2. 5 mM), and 120 mg (i. P). The primary end point was a model for the treatment of each group. Decreased levels of linagliptin (H 2) was used to evaluate the effect of GABA supplementation on the heart rate.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study showed that DPP-4 is a beneficial effect on the heart rate of cardiovascular injury in STZ rats. These results suggest that GABA supplementation may be a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of salt-sensitive.

## Human Abstract:
Background It remains to be elucidated whether dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor can ameliorate cardiovascular injury in salt-sensitive hypertension. The present study was undertaken to test our hypothesis that linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, administration initiated after onset of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy can ameliorate cardiovascular injury in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats (DS rats). Methods High-salt loaded DS rats with established hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were divided into two groups, and were orally given (1) vehicle or (2) linagliptin (3 mg/kg/day) once a day for 4 weeks, and cardiovascular protective effects of linagliptin in DS rats were evaluated.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our work provided the evidence that DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin protected against cardiovascular injury in salt-sensitive hypertensive rats, independently of blood glucose or blood pressure. These beneficial effects of linagliptin were associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress and cardiac ACE. Since linagliptin initiated after onset of hypertension was shown to exert positive therapeutic cardiovascular effects, our work highlights linagliptin as potentially a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of macrovascular disease in patients with coexisting diabetes and hypertension. However, further clinical trials investigating the effect of DPP-4 inhibition on cardiovascular outcome is required to define our proposal

Methods: Eight-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control (CON), intermittent hypoxia (IH), exercise (EXE), or IH combined with exercise (IHEXE) groups. These groups were randomly assigned to subgroups receiving either a vehicle or the NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide. The EXE and IHEXE rats underwent exercise training on an animal treadmill for 10 weeks (5 days/week, 60 min/day, 24–30 m/min, 2–10% grade
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, IH-induced Cardiac fibrosis is associated with NHE-1 hyperactivity. However, exercise training exerted an inhibitory effect to prevent myocardial NHE-1 hyperactivity, which contributed to reduced IH-induced Cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, NHE-1 plays a critical role in the effect of exercise in IH-induced increased Cardiac fibrosis.

hyponatremia and Congestive Heart failure: A Marker of Increased Mortality and a Target for Therapy
## Entities:
congestive heart failure; Heart failure; heart failure; Hyponatremia; hyponatremia
## System Abstract:
Introduction: Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between hyponatremia and clinical outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure (STEMI). Methods: Prospective analysis of Heart failure (CHF) and Congestive aortic banding (PE) were performed in a prospective cohort. Serum levels of serum creatinine (MDA), and inflammatory markers were measured using the search of Controlled criteria for the diagnosis and intervention. Results: The results showed that the presence of the prostaglandin E 2 (P < 0. 001) and the increase of breath in a dose-dependent manner.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that hyponatremia is an independent predictor of breath and clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI. Our findings suggest that the relationship between serum levels and inflammatory markers are associated with a higher risk of developing morbidity and mortality. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the increase in MDA may be useful for the treatment of congestive heart failure and PE in the diagnosis of CHF.

The role of heart failure in patients with congestive heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Heart failure is one of the most common chronic medical conditions in the developed world. It is characterized by neurohormonal activation of multiple systems that can lead to clinical deterioration and significant morbidity and mortality. In this regard, hyponatremia is due to inappropriate and continued vasopressin activity despite hypoosmolality and volume overload. hyponatremia is also due to diuretic use in an attempt to manage volume overload. When hyponatremia occurs, it is a marker of Heart failure severity and identifies patients with increased mortality. The recent introduction of specific vasopressin-receptor antagonists offers a targeted pharmacological approach to these pathophysiological derangements.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Hyponatremia in HF is a frequent occurrence related to the activation of a multitude of neurohormonal pathways including the SNS, RAAS, and particularly the increased release of AVP. In addition to being common, Hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality in the HF population. The treatment has traditionally consisted of RAAS and SNS blockade in combination with loop and thiazide diuretics and dietary water restriction. While this approach can be effective, diuretics have several detrimental metabolic side effects and may potentially worsen Hyponatremia and cardiac function. Vasopressin antagonism represents a logical goal in the management of Hyponatremia in the HF population.

## Entities:
viral myocarditis; dilated cardiomyopathy; Dilated Cardiomyopathy; Ivabradine; Viral Myocarditis
## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of Ivabradine on Progression in the general population. Methods: Thirty-six patients with Viral Myocarditis were randomly assigned to either the same groups: control group (n = 10), and the controls were included. The results indicate that the addition of the main constituent of the basal ganglia was used as a result in the treatment of the disease. In the first time, the patient was treated with a single dose of 200 mg L −1, followed by a combination of 0. 5% air.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that Ivabradine is an effective treatment option for Progression in the general population. Therefore, it may be useful for the prevention of patients with Viral Myocarditis.

The role of Ivabradine in patients with Viral Myocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
To study the beneficial effects of Ivabradine in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mice, which evolved from coxsackievirus B3-induced chronic Viral Myocarditis. Four-to-five-week-old male balb/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with coxsackievirus B3 (Strain Nancy) on days 1, 14, and 28. The day of the first virus inoculation was defined as day 1. Thirty-five days later, the surviving chronic Viral Myocarditis mice were divided randomly into two groups, a treatment group and an untreated group. Ivabradine was administered by gavage for 30 consecutive days in the treatment group, and the untreated group was administered normal saline.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The findings suggest a therapeutic effect of Ivabradine in preventing the progression from viral myocarditis to DCM in mice with chronic viral myocarditis induced by coxsackievirus B3, is associated with inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway, downregulated inflammatory responses and decreased collagen expression. Ivabradine appears a promising approach for the treatment of patients with viral myocarditis. Further experimental and clinical studies are welcome in the future

## System Abstract:
Background prostacyclin (NASH) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of iloprost on pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Methods Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 7), and pulmonary fibrosis (CTL). The lungs were collected from the substantia nigra (SN), and the animals were sacrificed. Results The expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β1 was significantly higher in a dose-dependent manner in a mouse model.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that iloprost could suppress the expression of NASH in mice. Our findings suggest that the inhibition of TGF- signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
## System New Title:
The role of fibrosis in the rat model of pulmonary fibrosis in rats.


## Human Abstract:
Background Metabolites of arachidonic acid such as prostacyclin (PGI 2) have been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators. In this investigation, we examined whether iloprost, a stable PGI 2 analogue, could prevent bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model. Methods Mice received a single intratracheal injection of bleomycin with or without intraperitoneal iloprost. Pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were analysed by histological evaluation, cellular composition of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and hydroxyproline content. Lung mechanics were measured.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, these observations provide evidence for a beneficial role of PGI 2 in dampening pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, possibly through inhibiting recruitment of inflammatory cells (predominantly lymphocytes) and decreasing production of TNFα, IL-6 and TGFβ1, while promoting the generation of IFNγ and IFNγ-targeted CXCL10/IP-10, which are anti-fibroproliferative

Nedd4-1 is an exceptional prognostic biomarker for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and functionally associated with metastasis
## Entities:

## System Abstract:
Background Nedd4-1 (IGF2) is a common malignancy in the majority of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathological significance of Ang-1 and functionally associated with metastasis. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the mRNA and protein expression of adenocarcinoma in the presence of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, and to identify biomarker target genes involved in the invasiveness of gastric cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and pathological characteristics of these two cases, including colon adenocarcinomas and controls. The primary endpoint was the first step in the treatment of tumor progression and survival.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Ang-1 is a prognostic factor in the treatment of gastric cancer and metastasis. Our results suggest that the expression of adenocarcinoma and functionally associated with tumor progression may be related to the development of survival.

## Human Abstract:
Background Gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) is the most aggressive subtype of gastric carcinoma. New molecular markers and therapeutic targets are needed for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of GCA. This study is to establish the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the survival and guide the treatment of GCA patients. Methods Expression of Nedd4-1 in 214 GCA tumor samples was detected by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) using tissue microarray assay (TMA). Association of Nedd4-1 with cumulative survival of the TNM stages I-III patients and clinicopathological characteristics was statistically analyzed.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 is overexpressed in 83% of GCA tumors. The expression of Nedd4-1 is inversely associated with cumulative survival of GCA patients. Nedd4-1 negative GCA patients had a striking high survival rate, suggesting that Nedd4-1 negative staining could be used for prediction of post-surgery survival of GCA. Overexpression of Nedd4-1 is tightly associated with TNM stage of GCA, and knockdown of Nedd4-1 in gastric cancer cells dramatically reduces the cell migration and invasion capability, indicating that Nedd4-1 is functionally associated with GCA metastasis. Our studies conclude that Nedd4-1 is an exceptional prognostic biomarker for prediction of post-surgery survival and a potential anti-metastatic target in GCA therapy

## System Abstract:
Background Air (interleukin-6) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of air pollution and inflammation on the association between PM 2. 5 and CRP levels. Methods A total of 56 adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 30), LC, and healthy controls. Serum samples were collected in the morning, Egypt, and serum creatinine measurements. Results We found that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of saturated fatty acid (FFA), and IL-6 (r =.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that hs-CRP pollution and inflammation may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of PM 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association between air and CRP levels in patients with MI.

## Human Abstract:
Background Numerous studies have found that ambient air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular disease exacerbation. Objectives Given previous findings, we hypothesized that particulate air pollution might induce systemic inflammation in myocardial infarction (MI) survivors, contributing to an increased vulnerability to elevated concentrations of ambient particles. Methods A prospective longitudinal study of 1,003 MI survivors was performed in six European cities between May 2003 and July 2004. We compared repeated measurements of interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) with concurrent levels of air pollution. We collected hourly data on particle number concentrations (PNC), mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM) < 10 μm (PM 10) and < 2.5 μm (PM 2.5), gaseous pollutants, and meteorologic data at central monitoring sites in each
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results indicate an immediate response of IL-6 to ambient air pollution, which might lead to the synthesis of acute-phase proteins, as indicated by increased fibrinogen levels. The lack of detectable associations for CRP may be attributed to a widespread intake of statins in our population, which might suggest a protective effect against environmental, proinflammatory stimuli—an intriguing phenomenon that deserves further study

## System Abstract:
Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between Air air pollution (TC) and arrhythmias in the development of arrhythmia. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the electrophysiological data obtained from a cohort of atrial fibrillation (n = 71) and age-matched healthy controls (CTL). A total of 197 particulate matter (PM 2. 5 μm) was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results We found a higher risk of myocardial infarction (≤ 50 %) and increased mortality in the general population.

Association between serum arrhythmias and risk factors in patients with Ventricular tachyarrhythmias: a cross-sectional study.


## Human Abstract:
Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a consistent link between sudden cardiac deaths and particulate air pollution. We used implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) records of ventricular tachyarrhythmias to assess the role of air pollution as a trigger of these potentially life-threatening events. The study cohort consisted of 203 cardiac patients with ICD devices in the Boston metropolitan area who were followed for an average of 3.1 years between 1995 and 2002. Fine particle mass and gaseous air pollution plus temperature and relative humidity were measured on almost all days, and black carbon, sulfate, and particle number on a subset of days.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We found that Ventricular tachyarrhythmias among patients with ICDs increased with air pollution on the same and previous days, but these associations did not reach statistical significance. However, among patients with a recent tachyarrhythmia, the increased risk of a follow-up ventricular tachyarrhythmia associated with air pollution was large and statistically significant. These observations suggest that air pollution may act in combination with a cardiac electrical instability to increase the risk for Ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Among such acutely vulnerable ICD patients, there was an exposure response with PM 2.5, BC, NO 2, CO, and SO 2, which we interpret as indicators of mobile source pollution, and also evidence of an association with SO 4, which we interpret as an indicator of power plant and other stationary fossil fuel combustion

## Human Abstract:
Strong evidence suggests that type 2 Diabetes confers a stronger excess risk of Cardiovascular Diseases in women than in men; with women having a 27% higher relative risk of stroke and a 44% higher relative risk of coronary heart disease compared with men. The mechanisms that underpin these sex differences in the associations between Diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk are not fully understood. Some of the excess risk may be the result of a sex disparity in the management and treatment of Diabetes, to the detriment of women. However, accruing evidence suggests that real biological differences between men and women underpin the excess risk of Diabetes-related cardiovascular risk in women such that there is a greater decline in risk factor status in women than in men in the transition from normoglycemia to overt
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
There is accumulating evidence that the impact of type 2 diabetes on cardiovascular risk differs profoundly between the sexes and is more hazardous for women than for men. Although this may in part reflect a treatment disparity between women and men with diabetes, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that real behavioural and biological sex differences exist which may underpin the excess risk of diabetes-related cardiovascular risk in women. A greater deterioration in risk factor status in women than in men as they transition to diabetes, before the development of overt diabetes, appears to play a crucial role.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of resistance exercise training on weight loss in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study. RESULTS Exenatide, 44% had A1C reductions in weight loss, BMI and body mass composition, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined the impact of a hypocaloric diet with exenatide (P < 0. 001) on glycemia and waist circumference. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either glargine (n = 137) or placebo (control group).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that resistance exercise training on weight loss and obese patients with type 2 diabetes and T2DM in overweight subjects with exenatide. However, the results of these findings suggest that the effects of glargine may be beneficial for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of two low-fat hypocaloric diets differing in the carbohydrate-to-protein ratio, with and without resistance exercise training (RT), on weight loss, body composition, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk outcomes in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 83 men and women with type 2 diabetes (aged 56.1 ± 7.5 years, BMI 35.4 ± 4.6 kg/m 2) were randomly assigned to an isocaloric, energy-restricted diet (female subjects 6 MJ/day, male subjects 7 MJ/day) of either standard carbohydrate (CON; carbohydrate: protein: fat 53:19:26) or high protein (HP; 43:33:22), with or without supervised RT (3 days/week) for 16
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study showed substantial improvements in CVD risk factors and glycemic control following lifestyle intervention incorporating a structured, energy-restricted diet that occurred independent of macronutrient composition or participation in a RT program in sedentary obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The addition of RT increased weight and fat mass loss, which was further magnified by replacing some dietary carbohydrate with protein. The HP+RT group exhibited at least a 3.3-kg greater weight and fat loss and 21% greater reduction in WC compared with the other treatment groups. Previous studies in healthy, overweight/obese individuals without type 2 diabetes show greater reductions in weight and fat mass of similar magnitude when exercise training is combined with a hypocaloric HP diet compared with an isocaloric CON diet (6, 7

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of transforming morphogenetic protein (CRP) levels in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy (PD). Methods: Levels of cardiovascular alterations (8-OHdG) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis (n = 16), and to investigate the association between serum soluble endoglin (SLE) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), triglyceride (MI), hypertension, and kidney disease (CKD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results demonstrate that CRP levels in hypertensive patients with PD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, IL-6, and eGFR. These findings suggest that 8-OHdG may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.

## Human Abstract:
Background endoglin is involved in the regulation of endothelial function, but there are no studies concerning its relation with hypertension- and diabetes-associated pathologies. Thus, we studied the relationship between plasma levels of soluble endoglin and cardiovascular alterations associated with hypertension and diabetes. Methods We analyzed 288 patients: 64 with type 2 diabetes, 159 with hypertension and 65 healthy patients. We assessed the relationship of soluble endoglin plasma levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with basal glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction (assessed by pressure wave velocity), hypertensive retinopathy (by Keith-Wagener classification), left ventricular hypertrophy (by Cornell and Sokolow indexes), cardiovascular risk and target organ (heart, vascular, kidney )
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
endoglin expression has revealed its prognostic and diagnostic value in other circumstances, being a potential vascular target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy [ 13 ]. Our study shows the emerging role of endoglin as an indicator of diabetes-associated vascular pathologies such as hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. While much more work must be done to fully understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of endoglin in these pathologies, this study provides new research strategies for better diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction. These results are innovative and relevant enough to start prospective studies that will allow us to establish the relative strength of the prediction of cardiovascular risk and the appearance of target organ damage according to the endoglin levels presented by

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Its levels of eGFR in patients with newly diagnosed Newly 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 122 subjects were included in this cross-sectional observational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were divided into three groups: control group (n = 20), and diabetic retinopathy (< 120 mg/dL). The primary endpoint was the proportion of the disease. Results The mean difference was found to increase the risk of CAD in the liver and capillary endothelial cells (P < 0. 001) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that serum CVD levels are associated with increased risk of CAD in patients with newly diagnosed Newly 2 diabetes. The findings of the present meta-analysis suggested that eGFR and Its markers were found to be a prognostic factor in the liver and capillary endothelial cells. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of these biomarkers in the development of cardiovascular disease.

Aim The purpose of the study was the simultaneous measurement of all the different components of the AGE-RAGE axis as well as several non-invasive markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Materials and Methods In 80 newly diagnosed diabetic patients we measured serum carboxymethyllysine (CML), soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and peripheral mononuclear (PMNC) RAGE and AGER1 mRNA together with ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and malondialdehyde (MDA). We also assessed cardiovascular function by measurement of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), intima-media thickness (IMT) and arterial stiffness.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results show a significantly and strong association between the different components of the AGE-RAGE axis and also found significant association between AGE-RAGE axis markers, especially sRAGE, with several noninvasive markers of Cardiovascular Disease risk. These findings support the use of sRAGE, a simple assay, as a biomarker of AGE-RAGE activity in patients with diabetes

## System Abstract:
Abstract Rationale: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with deep vein thrombosis (ACS). We report a case of a 70-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, syncope, and diarrhea. She was found to have an increased risk of pulmonary embolism. She had a right lower quadrant disorder (PE). The patient was diagnosed with a history of 2. 6% of the left legs. She had a predilection for the diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we report a rare case of a patient with a history of ACS, especially in patients with deep vein thrombosis. Patients with DVT should be considered as a cause of morbidity and mortality.

Comparison of Thrombosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a rare disease that causes deep vein Thrombosis (DVT) in young females (age 20 to 50). DVT is caused by mechanical obstruction of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery resulting in stasis rather than a primary hypercoagulable state. Although MTS is found in 22% of cadavers, it causes < 5% of lower extremity venous disorder. Greater than 70% compression is needed to cause DVT. MTS patients usually present with acute left leg edema. Many cases are recurrent with a past workup negative for other etiologies of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
MTS is still vastly under-recognized. It is important to include MTS as one of the mainstream differential diagnoses of DVT along with PE in young women, especially if the etiology is not obvious. An aggressive evaluation of PE and lower extremity DVT for MTS could decrease mortality and morbidity significantly. Prognosis with MTS is very good if promptly identified and treated with an endovascular approach

## System Abstract:
Background Emerging evidence indicates that PuerARIn stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of puerarin on substantia nigra (SN) expression and autophagy. Material/Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to the control group (n=10) and wild-type (WT) mice. At 24 h after the induction of Apoptosis, the expressions of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results demonstrate that puerarin could suppress the protective effects of SN and autophagy. Our findings suggest that PuerARIn stress may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.

## Human Abstract:
Background PuerARIn has protective effects on ischemia-reperfusion injury, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully revealed. This study explored the effect of PuerARIn on the expression of Bcl-2 associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) in an in vitro model of anoxia/reoxygenation injury (A/RI) in neonate rat primary cardiomyocytes and the functions of BAG3 in A/RI. Material/Methods BAG3 expression in cardiomyocytes with or without PuerARIn pre-treatment was quantified using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The effects of BAG3 on A/RI were studied by measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphate kinase (CPK), the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
puerARIn can directly increase BAG3 transcription and translation in cardiomyocytes after A/RI. The elevated BAG3 expression presents protective effects on A/RI through enhancing autophagy and reducing apoptosis, which is a novel protective mechanism of puerARIn in A/RI

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the association of copeptin, IGFBP-1, and all‐cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (AMI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, single-center, clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Myocardial Infarction (NETs) in the treatment of acute MI and Acute coronary artery disease (CAD). The primary endpoint was the first time, and the relationship between microalbuminuria and Cardiovascular risk factors in relation to the severity of CHD.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of the present study showed that copeptin, IGFBP-1, and all‐cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the association between NETs and Cardiovascular risk factors were observed in the treatment of acute MI. Therefore, it is important to confirm the role of microalbuminuria in the management of CHD in CAD.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To determine whether C-terminal provasopressin (copeptin) explains the prognostic importance of insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) in patients with Myocardial Infarction and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS copeptin and IGFBP-1 were analyzed in 393 patients participating in the diabetes Mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) 2 trial. RESULTS copeptin was associated with IGFBP-1 (Spearman rank correlation test, r = 0.53; P < 0.001). During follow-up there were 138 cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, Myocardial Infarction, and stroke). In univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses both biomarkers were predictors of events: the hazard ratio for log copeptin was 1.59 (95% CI 1.41–1.81; P < 0.001) and for log IGFBP-1 was 1.49 (1.26–1.77; P < 0.001
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present observation of a correlation between the levels of Copeptin and IGFBP-1, combined with the stimulatory effect of desmopressin on IGFBP-1 (7), suggests a pathogenic relationship between vasopressin and IGFBP-1. Activation of the AVP system, mainly regulated by serum osmolality (10), may be detrimental in patients with myocardial infarction by increasing left ventricular afterload due to vasoconstriction and preload due to renal water reabsorbtion (10). This study adds IGFBP-1 as a new effector of vasopressin-mediated stress response in myocardial infarction. The exact reasons are unclear, but there are plausible explanations.
## Human New Title:
Copeptin is an independent predictor of diabetic heart disease and death

Association of obesity and long-term mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction with and without diabetes mellitus: results from the MONICA/KORA myocardial infarction registry
## Entities:
diabetes; acute myocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; myocardial infarction; obesity
## System Abstract:
Background Cardiovascular disease (CAD) is associated with increased mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between obesity and long-term outcome in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods We reviewed the medical records of data from the Netherlands Study of the MONICA/KORA Prevention Trial. Participants were classified according to the inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of the left ventricular mass index (BMI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and atherosclerotic attack (HR).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, the association between obesity and long-term outcome in AMI is associated with increased risk of CAD in patients with ST-segment elevation.

## Human Abstract:
Background Paradoxically, beneficial effects of overweight and obesity on survival have been found in patients after cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This obesity paradox has not been analyzed in AMI patients with diabetes even though their cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is increased compared to their counterparts without diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this long-term study was to analyze the association between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality in AMI patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Methods Included in the study were 1190 patients with and 2864 patients without diabetes, aged 28-74 years, recruited from a German population-based AMI registry.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In AMI patients without diabetes we detected a significant protective effect of overweight and obesity on all-cause mortality, which attenuated with increasing observation time while remaining statistically significant. However, in AMI patients with diabetes being overweight or obese did not result in a survival benefit. Surprisingly, a paradoxical association was found in overweight AMI patients with diabetes who had received statins prior AMI and who had been prescribed with four EBMs at hospital discharge. In order to thoroughly investigate the association between BMI and all-cause mortality in patients with and without diabetes further studies are needed

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between Aldosterone and plasma levels of metabolic syndrome (IR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Cross-sectional study of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 107) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS Compared with a median follow-up period of 62 years, the mean age group, sex, and the level of triglycerides were measured. The associations between these two groups were studied and compared with those without MetS. In addition, the association between these parameters and increased mortality were significantly higher in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0. 01) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that Aldosterone and plasma levels are associated with a higher risk of IR and CRP. The association between these parameters were found to be a prognostic factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between these findings are not statistically significant.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE Several pathomechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS), most of which have not been investigated in African Americans (AAs). We examined the contribution of a selected panel of biomarkers to the development of MetS in Jackson Heart Study (JHS) participants in this investigation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated 3,019 JHS participants (mean age, 54 years; 64% women) with measurements for seven biomarkers representing inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ CRP ]), adiposity (leptin), natriuretic pathway (B-natriuretic peptide [ BNP ]), adrenal pathway (cortisol and Aldosterone), and endothelial function (endothelin and homocysteine
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In our community-based sample of AAs, we observed that circulating plasma aldosterone, CRP, and BNP concentrations were significantly associated with incident MetS and longitudinal changes in select MetS components. Our investigation illustrates the likely key role these biomarkers play in the development of MetS and cardiovascular disease (a major consequence of MetS) among AAs

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of microvascular obstruction and intramyocardial on contractile function in reperfused myocardial infarction (MI). Methods Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n = 6), sham, or anterior descending coronary intervention (PCI). The primary end point was the first time of the left ventricular (CTA), mitral regurgitation (SPECT), and balloon (IMH). Results. The results showed that the addition of the lesion was significantly increased in the presence of lumbar vertebra.

The role of myocardial infarction and LDLR in rats with acute coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), microvascular obstruction (MO) and intramyocardial heMOrrhage (IMH) adversely affect left ventricular reMOdeling and prognosis independently of infarct size. Whether this is due to infarct zone reMOdeling, changes in reMOte myocardium or other factors is unknown. We investigated the role of MO and IMH in recovery of contractility in infarct and reMOte myocardium. Methods Thirty-nine patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with T2-weighted and T2* imaging, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and myocardial tagging at 2, 7, 30 and 90 days following primary percutaneous coronary intervention for AMI.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The infarct zone following reperfused AMI deMOnstrates contractile recovery over time as measured by tissue tagging CMR. The presence of hypoenhancement on LGE, suggestive of MO, is associated with reduced functional recovery over time, affecting in particular endocardial and mid-myocardial functional recovery. Hypoenhancement on T2w and T2* imaging, suggestive of IMH, is associated with further reduction in infarct zone functional recovery. Both MO and IMH are independent predictors of impaired contractile recovery in the infarct zone, but neither independently affects reMOte myocardial contractility

## System Abstract:
Background Stroke is an important risk factor for ischemic Stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between carotid artery (MHO) and their impact on intima-media thickness (CIMT) in patients with middle-aged (AIS). Methods: A total of 57 consecutive young adults (age, sex, Sweden) were recruited from the National Health Insurance Research Database, and Central Register of Controlled Trials (NIHSS). The primary endpoint was the proportion of the incident population and to assess the association between the severity and outcome measures.

## Human Abstract:
Background Vascular morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) are high after Ischemic Stroke at a young age. Data on carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) as marker of atherosclerosis are scarce for young Stroke populations. In this prospective case–control study, we examined cIMT, the burden of vascular risk factors (RF) and their associations among young and middle-aged Ischemic Stroke patients and controls. We aimed to detect clinical and sub-clinical arterial disease. Methods This study was conducted in 150 patients aged 15–60 years and 84 controls free of CVD. We related RF to ultrasonographic B-mode cIMT-measurements obtained from 12 standardized multiangle measurements in the common carotid artery (CCA), carotid bifurcation (BIF) and internal carotid artery (ICA
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Stroke is associated with increased ICA-IMT already at a young age, related to a family history of CVD among the youngest patients and related to RF burden increasing with age. Also in CVD-free controls, RFs and subclinical atherosclerosis are prevalent. Our data suggest that vascular screening reveals established clinical and sub-clinical arterial disease requiring broad and aggressive treatment in order to prevent progressing CVD

## System Abstract:
Background lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common malignancy in non-small-cell China. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tumor suppressors on Treg cells (CSC) and its correlation with respect to the promotion of Cytosol miRNAs. Materials and Methods: Lung cancer was assessed by the National Cancer Institute Network (EGFR), and Web of Science, respectively. Of these patients were selected as the control group (n = 148), with a 5-year survival rate (TME), and the results were used to determine the expression levels of Fluid and antibodies.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results showed that tumor suppressors may be useful in the treatment of NSCLC. Therefore, it is important for the first time that the expression of Fluid and antibodies is a prognostic factor in the development of Cytosol miRNAs.

## Human Abstract:
The focus of this review is to provide an update on the progress of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for lung cancer. miRNAs are single-stranded, small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and show tissue-specific signatures. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNA expression patterns represent the in vivo status in physiology and disease. Moreover, miRNAs are stable in serum and other clinically convenient and available tissue sources, so they are being developed as biomarkers for cancer and other diseases. cancer is currently the primary driver of the field, but miRNA biomarkers are being developed for many other diseases such as cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Over the last decade, great progress has been made in the research of miRNAs and lung cancer. Several miRNAs with differential expression patterns in lung cancer tissues compared to normal tissues have been identified. Furthermore, aberrant expression patterns of miRNAs in lung cancer patients cannot only be detected in tumor tissues but also in body fluids and extracellular organelles such as exosomes. All these studies give weight to the conclusion that miRNAs are promising biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction, as well as targets of potential therapeutics for lung cancer. Yet, before they can be effectively integrated into the field of clinical oncology, there are several issues that need to be addressed: (1) Using miRNA array analysis, it is easy to find numerous miRNA candidates whose expressions vary in lung cancer tissue compared to the normal tissue, or whose expressions vary in lung cancer patients body fluids and exosomes compared to the healthy

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative real time (ICU) in a real-world setting. Methods A total of 160 patients with a history of tuberculous pericarditis (n = 130) were recruited in a tertiary care hospital. The primary outcome was based on the measurement of the disease and the presence of Xpert and unstimulated antibodies. Results The mean age of 18 years was significantly higher in the control group, and the controls were included. The patient was diagnosed with a median follow-up period.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that ICU is a useful tool for the treatment of tuberculous pericarditis in a real-world setting. The diagnostic accuracy of quantitative real time in patients with a history of Xpert and unstimulated antibodies should be considered as a biomarker for the management of the disease. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

The role of TB in the treatment of tuberculous pericarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and is an important treatable cause of heart failure in developing countries. Tuberculous aetiology of pericarditis is difficult to diagnose promptly. The utility of the new quantitative PCR test (Xpert MTB/RIF) for the diagnosis of TBP is unknown. This study sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF test compared to pericardial adenosine deaminase (ADA) and unstimulated interferon-gamma (uIFNγ) in suspected TBP. Methods From October 2009 through September 2012, 151 consecutive patients with suspected TBP were enrolled at a single centre in Cape Town, South Africa.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, uIFNγ offers superior accuracy for the diagnosis of microbiologically confirmed TBP compared to the new Xpert MTB/RIF test and the established ADA assay, performed using available Xpert MTB/RIF testing protocols without fluid-specific optimisation beyond simple centrifugation. These data suggest that the uIFNγ assay may be the optimal first line test for the diagnosis of TB pericarditis, and merits consideration for implementation in clinical practice. Furthermore, PF Xpert MTB/RIF, when combined with either ADA or uIFNγ, offers high sensitivity and specificity for TBP diagnosis. Studies are needed to test the utility and cost-effectiveness of a two-test strategy, which may be preferred in HIV-positive patients where biomarker specificity may be

The role of Resveratrol in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.


## Human Abstract:
Background Myocardial fibrosis is an essential hallmark of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) contributing to cardiac dysfunctions. Resveratrol, an antioxidant, exerts its anti-fibrotic effect via inhibition of oxidative stress, while the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. Periostin, a fibrogenesis matricellular protein, has been shown to be associated with oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the role of periostin in anti-fibrotic effect of Resveratrol in streptozocin (STZ) -induced diabetic heart and the underlying mechanisms. Methods diabetic mice were induced by STZ injection. After treatment with Resveratrol (5 or 25 mg/kg/day i.g) or Saline containing 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for 2 months, the hearts were detected for oxidative stress and cardiac fibrosis using western blot, Masson ’ s trichrome staining and Dihydroethidium (DHE )
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Taken all the results above together, our investigation demonstrates that periostin is a central element in diabetes related myocardium fibrosis, which is prevented by Resveratrol via inhibition of ROS/ERK/TGF-β pathway

## System Abstract:
Background To investigate the role of Matrine in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in vitro and in vivo analyses. Methods: The study was a set of a mouse model of human skin cancer cell lines. Cell viability was measured by immunohistochemical staining and transwell assay, respectively. Results The expression levels of apoptosis were significantly higher in the presence of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α pathway. Furthermore, the effect of exogenous chemotherapy was found to be overexpressed in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Human Abstract:
Matrine, a clinical drug in China, has been used to treat viral hepatitis, cardiac arrhythmia and skin inflammations. Matrine also exhibits chemotherapeutic potential through its ability to trigger cancer cell death. However, the mechanisms involved are still largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the major determinant for the cell death induced by Matrine in human hepatocellular carcinoma. We use human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and human hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft in nude mice as models to study the action of Matrine in hepatocellular cancers. We found that caspase-dependent and -independent Program Cell Death (PCD) occurred in Matrine-treated HepG2 cells, accompanied by the decreasing of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the increasing ROS
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present studies demonstrated that matrine can induce concomitantly caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death in HepG2 cells through Bid-regulated AIF (the best studied example of a ciPCD mediator) nuclear translocation pathway. The elucidation of the mechanism of matrine-induced ciPCD suggests a possible therapeutic role of matrine and its potential of combination with other chemotherapies targeting caspase-dependent pathway to treat heptacellular carcinoma

The mechanisms responsible are incompletely known and no specific treatment is presently defined. We evaluated the possible usefulness of two molecules promoting lipid oxidation, fenofibrate and metformin, in an experimental model of DCM, the Zucker diabetic rat (ZDF). Methods ZDF and controls (C) rats were studied at 7, 14 and 21 weeks.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
we found, in the model used, that fenofibrate had no adverse but rather favourable actions on DCM with mild reduction in TAG accumulation and fibrosis. These results strongly suggest that PPARα activators should not have deleterious effects on myocardium in subjects with DCM and could even be useful in such patients. metformin had a clear lowering effect on heart TAG content but did not reduce fibrosis and stimulated the expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes. Further studies are needed to clarify these effects of metformin, the mechanisms behind them and to determine whether they are present in humans or not

Levothyroxine Substitution in Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and the Risk of Myocardial Infarction and Mortality
## Entities:
Subclinical hypothyroidism; myocardial infarction; subclinical hypothyroidism; Myocardial Infarction; levothyroxine; Subclinical Hypothyroidism; subclinical hypothyroid; Levothyroxine
## System Abstract:
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Mortality (CHD) in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and Embase (2005). The primary endpoint was the proportion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (group), and the incidence of mortality. Results Of these cases, the prevalence of Levothyroxine was significantly higher in a dose-dependent manner.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the prevalence of MI and CHD in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of cardiovascular disease is associated with the severity of CVD. Our findings suggest that Levothyroxine may be a useful tool for the management of the relationship between these two groups. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

The Relationship between myocardial infarction and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ST: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors, yet only limited data exist on long-term outcome of Levothyroxine treatment of this condition with respect to hard end-points. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine effects of Levothyroxine treatment on Myocardial Infarction (MI), cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality, in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. Methods and Results Primary care patients aged 18 years and older that underwent thyroid function tests between 2000 and 2009 were enrolled. Participants were identified by individual-level linkage of nationwide registers. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism at baseline were included in the study.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, substitution treatment with levothyroxine in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, is not associated with lower mortality or decreased risk of myocardial infarction. Clinical randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this study.

The role of diabetes in the rat model of type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of the mortality world-wide, which is related to several risks, including the life style change and the increased Diabetes prevalence. The present study was to explore the preventive effect of zinc on the pathogenic changes in the aorta. Methods A genetic type 1 diabetic OVE26 mouse model was used with/without zinc supplementation for 3 months. To determine gender difference either for pathogenic changes in the aorta of diabetic mice or for zinc protective effects on Diabetes-induced pathogenic changes, both males and females were investigated in parallel by histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations, in combination of real-time PCR assay.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we demonstrated here that Zn supplementation provides a significant protection against diabetes-induced pathogenic changes in the aorta without gender difference in the type 1 diabetic mouse model. The aortic protection by Zn against diabetes-induced pathogenic changes is associated with the up-regulation of both Nrf2 and MT expression

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of technique in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus (RCC). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with mRCC who underwent surgical resection. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and 147 (OS), respectively. The median follow-up period was performed to assess the extent of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and percentage of < 3 months. Patients were treated with IV (TC), tricks (n = 29).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study suggest that technique is safe and effective treatment option for renal cell carcinoma patients with RCC. However, the efficacy of this regimen is available for the management of the disease.

A case report of the jejunum and safety of tumor necrosis in patients with unresectable tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Renal cell carcinoma represents 3% of all cancers. Around 4–10% of cases present with inferior vena cava involvement, generally with tumor thrombus. Clinical and preoperative stage will be classified depending of the thrombus extension. A high quality preoperative workup is essential to properly plan surgical approach. Complete surgical resection of the tumor is potentially the only curative treatment, although it supposes a real challenge due to operative difficulty, potential for massive bleeding or tumor pulmonary thromboembolism. Surgery includes techniques derived from transplantation surgery and, in some cases, cardiovascular intervention with cardiopulmonary bypass.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Radical surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with RCCIVCT. And adequate preoperative imaging is essential. Surgical maneuvers and techniques derived from liver transplantation provide excellent exposure and control of the IVC, avoiding the use of CPB in many cases. Level of the thrombus seems to be a survival independent predictor. Successful surgery may provide acceptable long-term survival rates and better quality of life. New targeted therapies may play a promising role as adjuvant therapy

Sedation in the intensive care unit with Remifentanil/propofol versus midazolam/fentanyl: a randomised, open-label, pharmacoeconomic trial
## Entities:
Propofol; remifentanil; fentanyl; propofol; Remifentanil; midazolam
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods A prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of propofol on the ability of Sedation in the general population. Patients with AE were randomized to receive either Remifentanil/propofol or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with unstable heart disease (AF) and midazolam/fentanyl (n = 39).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that propofol is safe and well-tolerated in the general population. The efficacy of sedation in patients with AE and midazolam/fentanyl in the United States were not statistically significant.
## System New Title:
Midazolam use of sedation in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Remifentanil is an opioid with a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Its organ-independent elimination and short context-sensitive half time of 3 to 4 minutes lead to a highly predictable offset of action. We tested the hypothesis that with an analgesia-based sedation regimen with Remifentanil and propofol, patients after cardiac surgery reach predefined criteria for discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) sooner, resulting in shorter duration of time spent in the ICU, compared to a conventional regimen consisting of midazolam and fentanyl. In addition, the two regimens were compared regarding their costs.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We conclude that analgesia and sedation with remifentanil and propofol can facilitate a higher turnover of patients by reducing time on mechanical ventilation and by shortening the overall length of ICU stay compared to a conventional regimen with midazolam and fentanyl. Higher drug costs of remifentanil and propofol are compensated by reduced personnel costs on the basis of earlier discharge and may even lead to cost-savings to the hospital, depending on the dosing algorithm. remifentanil and propofol are useful tools for analgesia and sedation during the weaning phase and for short to medium term sedation in the ICU

## System Abstract:
Background Multikinase (LVH) has been shown to be associated with heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sorafenib on pressure in rats. Methods Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=6), high-fat (HF), or atrial fibrillation (DM). The primary endpoint was the ability to induce apoptotic damage in vitro and in vivo. Results We found a dose-dependent manner in the left ventricular myocytes. The exact mechanism was significantly increased in the hearts.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results indicate that sorafenib on pressure induced by LVH in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure.
## System New Title:
Expression of sorafenib and hypertrophy of pressure in the rat model of breast cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt pathway.


## Human Abstract:
Background Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a potent risk factor for sudden death and congestive heart failure. Methods We tested the effect of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor (10 mg/kg, given orally, starting 2 days prior to banding, till sacrifice on day 14), on the development of LVH following aortic banding in rats. Results The latter resulted in significant LVH caused by both an increase in cardiomyocyte volume and interstitial collagen deposition. The observed LVH was entirely blocked by sorafenib downregulating both of these components. LVH was associated with PDGF-BB and TGFβ1 overexpression, as well as phosphorylation of c-Raf and ERK1/2.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We show here that sorafenib exhibits a regulatory role on the occurrence of left ventricular hypertrophy by blocking the rise in growth factors, and activation of the corresponding c-Raf-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and effector mechanisms including ANP production. This effect of sorafenib may be of importance in modulating the maladaptive hypertrophic response to pressure overload. Left ventricular hypertrophy due to systemic arterial hypertension or aortic valve stenosis is a frequently encountered situation in the clinical setting. The main new finding of this study of prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy by sorafenib in banded animals could therefore be potentially of clinical interest

## System Abstract:
Background Trefoil factor 3 (SCC) is a rare malignancy affecting the United States. The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathological significance of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the resected samples from a single institution between January 2010 and December 31, 2015. We analyzed the expression of genes in the presence of squamous cell carcinoma in lung cancer cells, and to identify prognostic factors. Results We found that the levels of differentially expressed protein kinase (AMPK), a marker of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is correlated with poor prognosis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that the expression of adenocarcinoma and AMPK may be a useful prognostic factor for treating lung cancer cells. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

The role of carcinoma in the treatment of lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Abstract In carcinoma, such as of the lung, the histological subtype is important to select an appropriate therapeutic strategy for patients. However, carcinomas with poor differentiation cannot always be distinguished on the basis of morphology alone nor on clinical findings. Hence, delineation of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 most common epithelial-origin carcinomas, is pivotal for selection of optimum therapy. Herein, we explored the potential utility of Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) as a biomarker for primary lung adenocarcinoma and extrapulmonary adenocarcinomas derived from different organs.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Identification of previously unutilized, sensitive biomarkers is still a priority for improved differential diagnosis of lung ADC and SCC. Although TTF-1 and CK7 are frequently expressed in lung ADC, 8, 33 and P63 and CK5/6 are frequently expressed in lung SCC, 7, 8, 34, 35 the sensitivity of these markers remains limited. For example, the expression of TTF-1 has been reported in 73% to 84.4% , and CK7 in 90% to 97% of lung ADCs, whereas the expression of P63 was reported in 75% to 95% and CK5/6 in 75% to 100% of lung SCCs, respectively.

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between copeptin and Cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 Diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, open-label, observational study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a surrogate marker or placebo (n = 53) or once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a history of CKD, and to the control group (CG). RESULTS During the end of the disease, the patient was treated with the clinician for the treatment of ZODIAC-31.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that copeptin and Cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 Diabetes with a history of CKD. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the association between the clinician and placebo are associated with a higher risk of the disease, but it may be an independent predictor for the treatment of ZODIAC-31. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE copeptin, a surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, has been associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality in patients with type 2 Diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease or acute myocardial infarction. For stable outpatients, these associations are unknown. Our aim was to investigate whether copeptin is associated with CV and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 Diabetes treated in primary care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with type 2 Diabetes participating in the observational Zwolle Outpatient Diabetes Project Integrating Available Care (ZODIAC) study were included. Cox regression analyses with age as time scale were used to assess the relationship of baseline copeptin with CV and all-cause mortality.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this prospective cohort of 1,195 patients with type 2 diabetes treated in primary care, we found Copeptin to be associated with CV and all-cause mortality. After adjustment for established CV risk factors, we observed only a trend between Copeptin and CV mortality, whereas the association of baseline plasma Copeptin with all-cause mortality remained significant. Our findings are of particular interest because the AVP system is potentially modifiable through pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and could provide a possible target for treatment and prevention of CV events and mortality in type 2 diabetes. Several studies have reported that plasma AVP levels are elevated in animals and patients with diabetes (4 – 7).

## System Abstract:
Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Role of galactomannan determinations (PCT) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of a teaching hospital with a diagnosis of critically ill, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were included in a randomized clinical trial. Blood samples were collected from the morning and evening. The primary endpoint was based on the severity of the disease and the respiratory system. Results We found a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) and increased levels of independence in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrates that PCT in patients with COPD with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have a higher risk of independence in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The results of this retrospective analysis showed that the increase in BP levels were significantly associated with the severity of the respiratory system. This is the first report of a diagnosis of critically ill in a teaching patient with a high level of the disease. These findings suggest that the protective effect of Role of galactomannan determinations in the ICU is an important prognostic factor for the treatment of these diseases.

The Role of critically ill in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Critically ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at particular risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Our aims were to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) galactomannan (GM) has a higher sensitivity and specificity than serum GM or lower respiratory tract (LRT) sample culture. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate what the optimal cut-off value would be for BALF GM. Methods In this prospective single-center study, BALF and serum samples were collected from critically ill COPD patients on the first day of their intensive care unit admission. Results Of 50 critically ill COPD patients admitted, BALF and serum samples were collected in 34 patients.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Compared to serum GM and LRT Aspergillus isolation, BALF GM appears to have a higher sensitivity in the early diagnosis of IPA in critically ill COPD patients. The ROC curve suggests a possible cut off value of 0.8 for BALF specimens. Evidence-based prospective studies are needed for further evaluation of the usefulness and standardization of the procedure of BALF GM in critically ill COPD patients

## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of heart failure in patients with cardiac surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the Department of Heart Failure. We performed a retrospective review of the literature on the clinical relevance of the Biomarker and a predictor of mortality in a patient with heart failure. We also evaluated the relationship between the level of the Steroid and a Predictor (CG) on the prognosis of CHF. Results The median age of 59 months was significantly higher in the right ventricle, and the levels of the sympathetic nervous system (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results suggest that heart failure in patients with cardiac surgery in a patient with heart failure. The findings of the present study showed that the level of the Steroid is the most important prognostic factor for the treatment of CHF.

## Human Abstract:
Cardiovascular diseases remain the main cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide; primary prevention is a priority for physicians. Biomarkers are useful tools able to identify high-risk individuals, guide treatments, and determine prognosis. Our aim is to investigate Endogenous Ouabain (EO), an adrenal stress hormone with hemodynamic effects, as a valuable Biomarker of Heart Failure. In a population of 845 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, we have investigated the relationships between EO and echocardiography parameters/plasmatic Biomarker of cardiac function. EO was found to be correlated negatively with left ventricular EF (p = 0.001), positively with Cardiac End-Diastolic Diameter (p = 0.047), and positively with plasmatic NT-proBNP level (p = 0.02
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This work tried to investigate the relationship among EO and several clinical and biological heart-related variables in order to assess EO as a new and valuable Biomarker for Heart Failure. Moreover, we investigated the role of EO pre- and postoperative levels on cardiovascular mortality after cardiac surgery. The main results were the evidence of correlations between EO and several echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function. EO correlates negatively with LVEF (p = 0.001) and positively with Cardiac End-Diastolic Diameter (p = 0.047). Moreover, an increase in plasma EO concentration is associated with an analogue increase of plasmatic NT-proBNP (p = 0.02), a well-known and well-accepted Biomarker of cardiac

The Relationship between Preeclampsia and HMGB1 Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study.


## Human Abstract:
Background preeclampsia is a severe pregnancy disorder often complicated by reduced fetal growth or preterm delivery and is associated with long‐term maternal morbidity and mortality. We aimed to assess the association between preeclampsia phenotypes and risk of subsequent Coronary Heart Disease and maternal cardiovascular mortality. Methods and Results Women aged 16 to 49 years who gave birth during 1980–2002 and registered in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway were followed prospectively (1–29 years) for an incident major coronary event and mortality through linkage with the Cardiovascular Disease in Norway 1994–2009 (CVDNOR) project and the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results demonstrate that development of preeclampsia increases the maternal risk of nonfatal or fatal coronary events and CVD mortality later in life. The increased risk associated with preeclampsia was observed both in mothers with only 1 and in those with 1 lifetime pregnancies. In the latter group, the increased risk for future adverse events was not related to timing of preeclampsia in relation to parity (ie, preeclampsia in the first versus preeclampisa in later pregnancies). When associated with Preterm Delivery and/or SGA babies, the risk of future adverse coronary events associated with preeclampsia was even higher.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRP) are regulators of Wnt-signalling. SFRP4 has been shown to regulate insulin exocytosis and is overexpressed in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here we characterized the relation of SFRP4 to glucose and triglyceride metabolism and outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease on statin treatment in the prospective Homburg Cream & Sugar Study (NCT00628524). Methods Fasting SFRP4 concentrations were measured by ELISA in 504 consecutive patients with stable CAD confirmed by angiography. Results The median age was 68 years and 83% of patients were male. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in all patients without known diabetes for metabolic characterization.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This prospective study shows that higher SFRP4 concentrations are associated with T2DM and the metabolic syndrome in well-treated patients with coronary artery disease. SFRP4 concentrations are a novel marker of impaired glucose and triglyceride metabolism, but do not predict cardiovascular outcome in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Further research is necessary to elucidate the relevance of SFRP4 levels in healthy people and patients with cardiovascular disease and its prognostic value for diabetes and cancer

## Human Abstract:
Aims Diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by myocardial structural and functional changes, is a specific cardiomyopathy develops in patients with diabetes mellitus. The present study was to investigate the role of kinin B2 receptor-Akt-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3β signalling pathway in mediating the protective effects of tanshinone IIA (TSN) on Diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods and results Streptozocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats (n = 60) were randomized to receive TSN, TSN plus HOE140 (a kinin B2 receptor antagonist), or saline. Healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 20) were used as control.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our findings underscore the cardioprotective effects of TSN. TSN improves cardiac performance by inhibiting apoptosis, alleviating mitochondria ultrastructure changes and reducing inflammatory cytokine production in experimental Diabetic cardiomyopathy. TSN induced cardio-protective effects are mediated, at least in part, through the kinin B2 receptor-Akt-GSK-3β signalling pathway

Methods: In this prospective, observational, randomized, controlled, clinical trials, we investigated the role of HMGB1 in the treatment of the left femoral artery, and to explore the mechanisms involved in the development of the disease. In addition, mesenteric vein thrombosis was used to measure the expression of the inflammatory response in a rat model.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that ischemia on lungs and heart failure of the disease and the expression of the inflammatory response to the end of the left femoral artery. The protective effect of HMGB1 on the development of the treatment of the I/R and the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the brain injury. Our results suggest that the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of the progression of the immune system.

## Human Abstract:
Background ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is harmful to the cardiovascular system and is responsible for the inflammatory response and multiple organ dysfunctions. In this study we investigated the effect of activated clotting time level on the aortic cross-clamping triggers a systemic inflammatory response and it effects to lungs and heart. Methods End organ concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) were determined in four groups of Spraque Dawley rats: ischemic control (operation with cross clamping received IP of 0.9% saline at 2 ml/kg n=7) Sham (operation without cross clamping, n=7), Heparin (ACT level about 200), High dose Heparin (ACT level up to 600) The infrarenal aorta was clamped for 45 minutes by a mini cross clamp approximately 1cm below the renal artery and 1cm iliac bifurcation in all groups without sham
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
ACT levels of 200, as used in the real-world clinical practice, should be maintained in the open heart surgery. No beneficial effects were seen with the use of higher levels of ACT in the present study. Taking into account that, bleeding complications will be much less the target dose of Heparin should be maintained at this level in daily practice

## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of Diabetic hyperplasia in diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 20) and normal saline (Group B). After a median follow-up period was performed to assess the relations between the expression of Neointimal and six months after the induction of sirolimus-eluting. Changes in the presence of a single dose of STZ (1 mg/kg) was measured before and after the procedure.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that the expression of Diabetic hyperplasia in diabetic rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus and six months after the induction of sirolimus-eluting. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role of Neointimal in the presence of STZ in the treatment of DN.

## Human Abstract:
Background Observational clinical studies have shown that patients with diabetes have less favorable results after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with the non-diabetic counterparts, but its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the changes of neointimal hyperplasia after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in a diabetic porcine model, and to evaluate the impact of aortic inflammation on this proliferative process. Methods diabetic porcine model was created with an intravenous administration of a single dose of streptozotocin in 15 Chinese Guizhou minipigs (diabetic group); each of them received 2 SES (Firebird, Microport Co, China) implanted into 2 separated major epicardial coronary arteries.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Neointimal hyperplasia persisted at 6 months after SES implantation in the diabetic porcine model, which may be, at least partly, related to an exacerbated inflammatory response within the diabetic blood vessel wall. Further studies are needed to assess the molecular mechanism of enhanced neointimal proliferation and effects of pharmacological intervention

## System Abstract:
Abstract Rationale: tyrosinemia type 1 (HCM) is a rare condition characterized by the left ventricle, which is associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in infancy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients admitted to the Department of Medicine Hospital in a tertiary care hospital in the right atrium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine the incidence of PV. Results We found a significant increase in the diagnosis of reversible lesions in a patient with a history of fracture.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our findings suggest that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy MRI is a rare complication of reversible lesions in a patient with a history of fracture.

## Human Abstract:
Background tyrosinemia type 1 (TT1) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). TT1 usually presents in infancy with features suggestive of liver disease or with sepsis-like symptoms. Case presentation We report two Saudi siblings with TT1. Case 1 was a male infant who presented at 2 months old with fever, vomiting and refusal of feeding. Examination revealed a sick-looking infant with signs of severe dehydration and hypovolemic shock. He was jaundiced, and had hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes. Echocardiography was performed in light of a lack of response to inotropes, and revealed biventricular and interventricular septal hypertrophies.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We report two infants with TT1. One presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but responded dramatically to tyrosine-free formula and NTBC. The second infant was diagnosed during the first week of life and remained asymptomatic after 9 months. This report highlights TT1 as a cause of treatable cardiomyopathy, and demonstrates the value of screening for the early diagnosis of TT1 to prevent associated morbidities

## System Abstract:
Background Cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide protein kinase inhibitors (PR) is a structurally fatal disease characterized by the activation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of cGMP-dependent in the loCal antihypertrophic effects on the mechanisms of action in the absence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Materials and Methods: In the first step, we evaluated the interactions between the expression of Ca 2+ and RGS2 isoforms on the surface of the cells and the underlying molecular mechanism.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results demonstrate that cGMP-dependent isoforms is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The role of hypertrophic in a rat model of isoforms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) loCally counteracts Cardiac hypertrophy via the guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) receptor and cGMP production, but the downstream signalling pathways are unknown. Here, we examined the influence of ANP on β-adrenergic versus Angiotensin II (Ang II) -dependent (G s vs. G αq mediated) modulation of Ca 2+ i -handling in Cardiomyocytes and of hypertrophy in intact hearts. L-type Ca 2+ currents and Ca 2+ i transients in adult isolated murine ventricular myocytes were studied by voltage-clamp recordings and fluorescence microscopy. ANP suppressed Ang II-stimulated Ca 2+ currents and transients, but had no effect on isoproterenol stimulation.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Patients with Cardiac hypertrophy and/or congestive heart failure have elevated plasma levels of ANP and BNP [ 25, 26 ]. However, the Cardiovascular and cGMP responses to these hormones are markedly attenuated, indiCating impaired receptor or post-receptor responsiveness of GC-A [ 25, 26 ]. Concurrently, the deleterious role of the loCal renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in Cardiac remodeling has been demonstrated by many experimental and cliniCal reports. Our study emphasizes that a disturbance of the deliCate systemic and also loCal, Cardiac balance between the ANP and RAA systems Can critiCally contribute to the progression of Cardiac hypertrophy

## System Abstract:
Purpose To investigate the gastroprotective effects of ZERumbone-Loaded on BALB/c mice. Methods: In this study, the effect of ZER administration on histopathology was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the retinal pigment thickness (ACC) is an important component of the skin barrier. However, it is not clear whether it could be useful for the treatment of lipid peroxidation. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a toxicity of Nanostructured ester (SLNs) on the intestinal absorption.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, this study showed that ZER administration of ZERumbone-Loaded on BALB/c mice on the intestinal absorption of lipid peroxidation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it may be useful as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of histopathology.

## Human Abstract:
ZERumbone- (ZER-) loaded nanostructure lipid carrier (NLC) (ZER-NLC) prepared for its antileukemia effect in vitro was evaluated for its toxicological effects by observing changes in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, heart, and brain tissues, serum biochemical parameters, total haemogram, and bone marrow stem cells. The acute toxicity study for ZER-NLC was conducted by orally treating BALB/c mice with a single dose with either water, olive oil, ZER, NLC, or ZER-NLC for 14 days. The animals were observed for clinical and behavioral abnormalities, toxicological symptoms, feed consumption, and gross appearance.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, overall results of this study clearly demonstrate that oral administration of both ZER and ZER-NLC at acute doses induced no behavioral alterations, toxicological signs, or any other adverse effects on the experimental animals during the fourteen-day test period, indicating that ZER-NLC offers significant potential as a novel sustainable release antitumor drug for cancer treatment without acute toxic side effect. Further in vivo antitumor studies of the ZER-NLC should be carried out to further confirm its antitumor effect especially on its antileukemic effect

## System Abstract:
In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of Polydatin on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into two groups: Control (n = 7) and normal saline (group B). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, nitric oxide (NO), and Remodeling kinase (MAPK) were measured. The expression of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was determined by Western blot analysis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Polydatin inhibited hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and its molecular effects on the expression of pulmonary hypertension and its antioxidant defense. The protective effect of PH on PQ-induced activity, and the inhibition of ROS production was observed in rats. These results indicate that the combination of the MAPK pathway may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of the mechanisms underlying the mechanism of action.
## System New Title:
The role of hypoxic in a rat model of cancer.


## Human Abstract:
hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening emergency if untreated. Consistent pulmonary hypertension also leads to arteries and ventricular remodeling. The clinical therapeutic strategy for pulmonary hypertension and the corresponding remodeling mainly interacts with NO, angiotensin II (Ang II) and elevated endothelin (ET) targets. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of Polydatin on hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. It was observed that Polydatin attenuated hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, reversed remodeling, and regulated NO, Ang II, ET contents in the serum and lung samples. However, forced activation of PKC signaling by its selective activator thymeleatoxin (THX) could abate the effects of polydatain.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Polydatin prevents hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension and reverses remodeling under hypobaric and hypoxic conditions. Polydatin also regulates the synthesis and release of NO, Ang II and ET, which contribute to pulmonary resistance and remodeling. The PKC activator THX could attenuate these effects of Polydatin on hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension rats, suggesting that the mechanism of action for Polydatin lies in its interaction with PKC signaling. Collectively, Polydatin might be a promising therapeutic strategy for hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension

## System Abstract:
Background heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Toll-like receptor 9 in a rat model of Polymicrobial (i. ALI). Methods: Male and thirty healthy controls were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n = 22) and normal saline (HF). The primary end point was preserved during the course of the disease. Results: The remaining 32 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were treated with a single dose of 5 μg/kg (sc).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 9 in i patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a single dose of sc in the rat model of Polymicrobial (DM). These findings suggest that PTZ-induced treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of heart failure.
## System New Title:

## Human Abstract:
Background. Aim was to elucidate the role of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in cardiac inflammation and septic heart failure in a murine model of polymicrobial Sepsis. Methods. Sepsis was induced via colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and TLR9-deficient (TLR9-D) mice. Bacterial load in the peritoneal cavity and cardiac expression of inflammatory mediators were determined at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 h. Eighteen hours after CASP cardiac function was monitored in vivo. Sarcomere length of isolated cardiomyocytes was measured at 0.5 to 10 Hz after incubation with heat-inactivated bacteria.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Taken together TLR9 signalling seems to be of critical importance in polymicrobial Sepsis as its absence increases survival of the animals dramatically via reduced cardiac inflammation. This attenuated cardiac inflammatory response allows the organism to preserve cardiovascular function, ultimately leading to better survival. Thus, pharmacological intervention of blocking TLR9 signalling shows promise as a new approach for treating polymicrobial Sepsis

## System Abstract:
Background Heart failure (HF) is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of dementia in relation to the severity of Heart Failure and to determine the relationship between plasma levels and mortality. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort of patients admitted to our hospital for the diagnosis of heart failure and different forms of CAD. Patients were divided into two groups: control group (n = 32) and controls (mean age 57 years). Plasma samples were analyzed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and a Cox proportional hazards model.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The prevalence of dementia is associated with the severity of Heart Failure and mortality in the diagnosis of heart failure. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between dementia and mortality in patients with dementia disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Aims Heart failure (HF) and dementia frequently coexist, but little is known about their types, relationships to each other and prognosis. The aims were to (i) describe patients with HF and dementia, assess (ii) the proportion of specific dementia disorders in types of HF based on ejection fraction and (iii) the prognostic role of types of HF and dementia disorders. Methods and results The Swedish Heart failure Registry (RiksSvikt) and The Swedish dementia Registry (SveDem) were record-linked. Associations between dementia disorders and HF types were assessed with multinomial logistic regression and survival was investigated with Kaplan–Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this study of the nationwide RiksSvikt and SveDem, HFPEF was the most common type of HF and vascular Dementia was the most common Dementia disorder. We did not observe any statistically significant associations between Dementia disorders and HF types or any statistically significant associations between HF type or Dementia disorder and survival

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the severity of life (HRQoL) and fatigue (COPD) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Materials and Methods: This prospective, observational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between May 2012 and December 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either cough-specific (n = 36) or placebo (FEV 1) or Depression scale (group 2). The primary endpoint was the proportion of the participants ’ s Global Assessment Scale (SF-36) and the presence of Life Questionnaire.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the severity of HRQoL and COPD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a significant increase in the risk of Life. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background cough is a prevalent symptom that impacts quality of life in COPD. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between cough-specific quality of life, abdominal muscle endurance, fatigue, and Depression in stable patients with COPD. Methods Twenty-eight patients with COPD (mean age 60.6±8.7 years) referred for pulmonary rehabilitation participated in this cross-sectional study. Sit-ups test was used for assessing abdominal muscle endurance. Leicester cough Questionnare (LCQ) was used to evaluate symptom-specific quality of life. fatigue perception was evaluated with fatigue Impact Scale (FIS).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, this study showed that worse cough-specific quality of life is associated with lower abdominal muscle endurance; higher fatigue impact on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial activities; and higher Depression level. Chronic cough can have profound effects on quality of life. Its management should include an assessment of health status. In the clinic of chest diseases and pulmonary rehabilitation programs, the LCQ can be used to assess longitudinal changes and identify the specific health domains affected in patients with COPD. 46 If cough is an important part of COPD and contributes to deterioration in quality of life, the symptom should be controlled.

Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction during acute myocardial infarction: Effect of Mild hypothermia
## Entities:
acute myocardial infarction; Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; Mild hypothermia; infarct; myocardial infarction; diastolic dysfunction; hypothermia
## System Abstract:
Background diastolic dysfunction (AMI) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of heart failure (MI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction echocardiography in relation to the severity of myocardial infarction. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 7), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The primary endpoint was a model of myocardial injury (AKI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results suggest that Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction echocardiography is effective in the treatment of myocardial infarction. However, it may be useful as a therapeutic option for patients with AMI.
## System New Title:
The role of myocardial infarction in patients with acute ST: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Mild hypothermia (MH) decreases infarct size and mortality in experimental reperfused myocardial infarction, but may potentiate ischaemia-induced left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Methods In anaesthetized pigs (70 ± 2 kg), polystyrol microspheres (45 μm) were infused repeatedly into the left circumflex artery until cardiac power output decreased 40% . Then, pigs were assigned to normothermia (NT, 38.0 °C, n = 8) or MH (33.0 °C, n = 8, intravascular cooling) and followed for 6 h (CME 6 h).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We demonstrate that a major mechanism of global LV pump failure in our model of no-reflow myocardial infarction relates to acute diastolic heart failure, as the LV is progressively unable to hold an adequate preload. MH attenuates this loss of compliance. In addition, MH improves systemic oxygen supply/demand imbalance at better preserved aortic pressures and may thus be a treatment option for cardiogenic shock
## Human New Title:
Systolic left ventricular function is preserved during therapeutic hypothermia, also during increases in heart rate with impaired diastolic filling

## Entities:
diabetes; Abdominal obesity; type 1 diabetes mellitus; obesity; abdominal obesity in type 1 diabetes mellitus; abdominal obesity
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia in a large number of patients with abdominal obesity in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A total of 58 subjects aged ≥20 years who were hospitalized for age, gender, ethnicity, body weight, and physical examination were examined. The percentage of waist circumference (WC) was measured using student ’ s National Health Insurance Research Database. Results The sample consisted of all participants who had been diagnosed with obesity, and the parents were included in the general population.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with abdominal obesity in type 1 diabetes mellitus was found to be an independent risk factor for obesity in the general population. However, it is important to consider the relationship between WC circumference in a large number of the disease.

Relationship between serum obesity and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background obesity is linked to cardiovascular diseases and increasingly common in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) since the introduction of intensified insulin therapy. Our main aim was to explore associations between obesity and depression, anxiety, alexithymia and self-image measures and to control for lifestyle variables in a sample of persons with T1DM. Secondary aims were to explore associations between abdominal and general obesity and cardiovascular complications in T1DM. Methods Cross sectional study of 284 persons with T1DM (age 18–59 years, men 56 %), consecutively recruited from one secondary care hospital diabetes clinic in Sweden.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Abdominal obesity in T1DM was associated with women, alexithymia, particularly the alexithymia subfactor “ difficulty identifying feelings ”, and physical inactivity. As Abdominal obesity is detrimental in diabetes due to its association with cardiovascular complications, our results suggest two risk factor treatment targets: increased emotional awareness and increased physical activity

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to assess the impact of anaemia on clinical outcomes in patients with Atrial Fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of data from the database of the AFCAS registry in a prospective observational cohort of the literature. The primary endpoint was the proportion of the left ventricular mass index (eGFR), and the presence of a large number of < 60 mL/min/1. 73 m 2 (30 %), respectively.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that anaemia was associated with clinical outcomes in patients with Atrial Fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the impact on the results of the present findings, it is necessary to confirm the role of thromboembolic in the management of PCI.

Association between anaemia and atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objectives anaemia has an adverse impact on the outcome in the general patient population undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of anaemia on the 12-month clinical outcome of patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) undergoing PCI and therefore requiring intense antithrombotic treatment. We hypothesised that anaemia might be associated with a worse outcome and more bleeding in these anticoagulated patients. Setting Data were collected from 17 secondary care centres in Europe. Participants Consecutive patients with AF undergoing PCI were enrolled in the prospective, multicenter AFCAS (Atrial Fibrillation undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting) registry.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Anaemia was a frequent finding in patients with AF referred for PCI. Anaemia seems to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality during 12-month follow-up. Anaemia is also associated with more MACCE and a trend towards a higher rate of bleeding

Patients were divided into two groups: control group (n = 57), and healthy controls (range = 16. 9). The primary endpoint was the diagnostic accuracy of the disease, and the severity of the diagnosis was evaluated.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The prevalence of acute myocarditis in patients with gadolinium enhancement of T1-mapping was found to be an independent risk factor for the treatment of CMR.

A case report of acute myocarditis and clinical outcomes in patients with Acute myocarditis: a retrospective cohort study.


## Human Abstract:
Background Acute myocarditis can be diagnosed on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) using multiple techniques, including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, which requires contrast administration. Native T1-mapping is significantly more sensitive than LGE and conventional T2-weighted (T2W) imaging in detecting myocarditis. The aims of this study were to demonstrate how to display the non-ischemic patterns of injury and to quantify myocardial involvement in acute myocarditis without the need for contrast agents, using topographic T1-maps and incremental T1 thresholds. Methods We studied 60 patients with suspected acute myocarditis (median 3 days from presentation) and 50 controls using CMR (1.5 T), including: (1) dark-blood T2W imaging; (2) native T1-mapping (ShMOLLI); (3 )
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Native T1-mapping can display the typical non-ischemic patterns in acute myocarditis, similar to LGE imaging without the need for contrast agents. T1-mapping also detected additional areas of myocardial involvement and identified extra cases beyond T2W and LGE imaging, improving the diagnostic confidence when conventional methods failed to identify abnormalities. In the future, it may be possible to perform gadolinium-free CMR using cine and T1-mapping for tissue characterization and may be particularly useful for patients in whom gadolinium contrast is contraindicated

## Entities:
Septic Shock; Sepsis; sepsis; septic shock; Corticosteroids
## System Abstract:
Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ACTH and Corticosteroids (TIMP-1), as well as a key factor in the development of septic shock and to explore the utility of the dynamic system in the setting of soft-tissue infection. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the Cochrane Library. All articles were included in this review, and scientific reviews were reviewed.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that ACTH and TIMP-1 are associated with the development of septic shock and mortality in the setting of soft-tissue infection. The results of this review suggest that the dynamic system is the most important prognostic factor for the management of patients with Sepsis.

The role of sepsis in patients with Septic Shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
sepsis is a common disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is now defined as an abnormal host response to infection, resulting in life-threatening dysfunction of organs. There is evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments in various animal models and in patients that endotoxin or sepsis may directly and indirectly alter the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal response to severe infection. These alterations may include necrosis or hemorrhage or inflammatory mediator-mediated decreased ACTH synthesis, steroidogenesis, cortisol delivery to tissues, clearance from plasma, and decreased sensitivity of tissues to cortisol. Disruption of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis may translate in patients with sepsis into cardiovascular and other organ dysfunction, and eventually an increase in the risk of
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
There are numerous experimental and clinical data establishing the paramount importance of an appropriate activation of the HPA axis to respond to severe infection. Similarly, experiments in animals and clinical observations strongly support the role of an inadequate HPA axis response in the physiopathology and outcome of Sepsis. In most animal studies, corticosteroid administration consistently protected against lethal Sepsis. In contrast, clinical trials in Sepsis found much less consistency in survival benefits from Corticosteroids, though most trials demonstrated faster resolution in shock and organ dysfunction. Thus, physicians should consider Corticosteroids mainly in septic shock who do not respond rapidly to fluid therapy and vasopressors.

## System Abstract:
Background Acute Myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of miR-21 on cardiac function in rats. Material/Methods We performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (VEGF) on the left ventricular (LV) remodeling. We evaluated the role of apoptosis in a rat model of acute coronary heart disease (AKI). The primary outcome was a significant increase in the myocardial volume (LVEF) and the control group (n = 7).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrated that miR-21 on cardiac function in rats of acute coronary heart disease. Our findings suggest that administration of VEGF in AMI may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AKI.

## Human Abstract:
Background This study investigated how miR-21 expression is reflected in acute Myocardial infarction and explored the role of miR-21 and the PTEN/VEGF signaling pathway in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Material/Methods We used an in vivo LAD rat model to simulate acute Myocardial infarction. MiR-21 mimics and miR-21 inhibitors were injected and transfected into model rats in order to alter miR-21 expression. Cardiac functions were evaluated using echocardiographic measurement, ELISA, and Masson staining. In addition, lenti-PTEN and VEGF siRNA were transfected into CMEC cells using standard procedures for assessing the effect of PTEN and VEGE on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, miR-21 exhibited protective effects on cell proliferation and angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, miR-21 regulated CMEC proliferation and angiogenesis through targeting and suppressing PTEN expression, which further elevated VEGF expression. PTEN is the downstream target of miR-21 and it down-regulates VEGF when angiogenesis is induced by miR-21

Association of Novel biomarkers of cardiovascular stress With left ventricular hypertrophy and Dysfunction: Implications for Screening
## Entities:

## System Abstract:
Background left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hypertrophy in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular stress and Dysfunction in Asians. Methods We performed a retrospective review of the literature regarding the association between genetic background biomarkers, including reversibility, smoking, and alcohol consumption. We also examined the associations between plasma and lipid profiles in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. They were subdivided into two groups: control group (n = 37) and controls (CTL).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results suggest that plasma and lipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular stress and Dysfunction is associated with a higher risk of LVH. The association between hypertrophy and alcohol levels were found to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease in a cohort of Asians.
## System New Title:
Association between hypertrophy and biomarkers in patients with cardiovascular stress: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Currently available screening tools for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) and systolic dysfunction (LVSD) are either expensive (echocardiography) or perform suboptimally (B‐type natriuretic peptide [ BNP ]). It is unknown whether newer biomarkers are associated with LVH and LVSD and can serve as screening tools. Methods and Results We studied 2460 Framingham Study participants (mean age 58 years, 57% women) with measurements of biomarkers mirroring cardiac biomechanical stress (soluble ST‐2 [ ST2 ], growth differentiation factor‐15 [ GDF‐15 ] and high‐sensitivity troponin I [ hsTnI ]) and BNP.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In our large community based‐sample, GDF‐15 and hsTnI were associated with the composite echocardiographic outcome, and with LVSD and LVH, respectively. These biomarkers also offered limited incremental predictive utility over clinical risk factors and BNP for identifying stage B HF. However, the clinical significance of the modest NRI values remains unclear, thereby rendering it challenging to advocate the use of these novel biomarkers for screening purposes in clinical practice. Additional studies of larger multi‐ethnic cohorts are warranted to confirm our results and further investigations are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of modest NRI values (which may be statistically significant )

## System Abstract:
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the risks of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with non-valvular thromboembolism (ICH). Methods: A total of 131 participants (mean age 45 years) were recruited from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), and to examine the relationship between standardised ischemic stroke and pulmonary embolism. Results We found a significant increase in the risk of ischemic Stroke in the general population, but the role of NOACs in the diagnosis of ATRIAl fibrillation was significantly higher in the control group (P < 0. 001) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our findings suggest that AF is a risk factor for the prevention of ATRIAl fibrillation in patients with ICH.

The role of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background More accurate and reliable stroke risk prediction tools are needed to optimize anticoagulation decision making in patients with ATRIAl fibrillation (AF). We developed a new AF stroke prediction model using the original Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in ATRIAl fibrillation (ATRIA) AF cohort and externally validated the score in a separate, contemporary, community‐based inception AF cohort, ATRIA–Cardiovascular Research Network (CVRN) cohort. Methods and Results The derivation ATRIA cohort consisted of 10 927 patients with nonvalvular AF contributing 32 609 person‐years off warfarin and 685 thromboembolic events (TEs). The external validation ATRIA‐CVRN cohort included 25 306 AF patients contributing 26 263 person‐years off warfarin and 496 TEs.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The ATRIA stroke risk score for AF patients was rigorously developed in a community‐based cohort and externally validated in a separate recently assembled community‐based AF cohort. Our results highlight the importance of including multiple categories of age, prior stroke, and their interaction in determining stroke risk in AF patients. The ATRIA score's performance was superior to the widely used CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc risk schemes in terms of c‐index and NRI. It identified a substantially larger fraction of patients at low stroke risk. Its performance was particularly good in predicting severe strokes, the category of stroke we are most interested in avoiding.

The effects of COPD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Cardiovascular diseases are prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Their coexistence implies that many COPD patients require anticoagulation therapy. Although more and more replaced by direct oral anticoagulants, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are still widely used. VKAs induce profound deficiency of vitamin K, a key activator in the coagulation pathway. It is recognized however that vitamin K is also an essential cofactor in the activation of other extrahepatic proteins, such as matrix Gla protein (MGP), a potent inhibitor of arterial calcification. No or insufficient MGP activation by the use of VKAs is associated with a rapid progression of vascular calcification, which may enhance the risk for overt
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Abundant circumstantial evidence, both from human observational studies and from animal intervention studies, points to a link between low vitamin K levels, elastin degradation and cardiovascular pathology in COPD patients. As VKAs are still widely used in this particular population concerns may rise on their long-term safety profile. Vitamin K intervention studies are warranted to reveal if vitamin K supplementation may play a role in the management of patients with COPD

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Ellagic Acid on the expression of eNOS and p47 in a rat model of L-NAME-Induced Hypertension. Material/Methods A total of 82 patients were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 20), and hypertension (< 60 years). Blood pressure (BP) was used to determine the degree of atherosclerotic plaque markers. Results The results showed that the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (p < 0. 001) was found to increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Ellagic Acid on the expression of eNOS in L-NAME-Induced Hypertension is associated with the risk of cardiovascular events in a rat model. Our findings suggest that the treatment of atherosclerotic plaque and p47 may be useful for the prevention of hypertension.

The role of Hypertension in patients with Ellagic Acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
The effect of Ellagic Acid on oxidative stress and Hypertension induced by N ω -Nitro- l -arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administrated with L-NAME (40 mg/kg/day) for five weeks. L-NAME induced high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and increased heart rate (HR), hindlimb vascular resistance (HVR) and oxidative stress. Concurrent treatment with Ellagic Acid (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) prevented these alterations. Co-treatment with Ellagic Acid was associated with up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein production and alleviation of oxidative stress as indicated by decreased superoxide production in the vascular tissue, reduced plasma malondialdehyde levels, reduced NADPH oxidase subunit p47 phox expression and increased plasma nitrate/nitrite
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study demonstrates that ellagic acid exhibits protective effects on the development of hypertension induced by a NOS inhibitor. These protective effects are associated with improved NO bioavailability, higher eNOS protein expression and reduced oxidative stress status, possibly due to a reduction in NADPH oxidase subunit p47 phox expression

## Human Abstract:
Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable lung disease with a poor prognosis. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are the key cells in the fibrotic process. Recently two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, were approved for clinical use as they are able to slow down the disease progression. The mechanisms by which these two drugs act in in vitro cell systems are not known. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the effects of pirfenidone and nintedanib on fibroblasts and myofibroblasts structure and function established from patients with or without IPF. Methods Stromal cells were collected and cultured from control lung (n = 4) or IPF (n = 7
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Combination of Pirfenidone and nintedanib reduced in vitro proliferation of stromal cells more than Pirfenidone or nintedanib alone. Both drugs affected collagen gel contraction potency, invasion capacity and myofibroblast features of cultured stromal cells derived from either healthy or IPF lung. We believe that cell culture based in vitro platforms could be used for screening new IPF drugs in the future. Effects of the drugs are, however, variable in different samples and therefore further studies are required for understanding this phenomenon

## System Abstract:
Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of fat intake on fatty liver and its role in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia. Methods C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: control group (n = 30), and obese age-matched controls. The rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and the OGTT was used to determine the relationship between the presence and absence of the transsulphuration pathway. Furthermore, the influence of the number of metabolic parameters was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrated that fat intake was associated with a significant increase in the development of NAFLD. Our findings suggest that elevated plasma levels may play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperhomocysteinemia.

## Human Abstract:
Background hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) causes increased oxidative stress and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress is now believed to be a major contributory factor in the development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disorder worldwide. In this study, the changes which occur in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism in high fat-diet induced non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats were investigated. Methods and results After feeding rats a standard low fat diet (control) or a high fat diet (57% metabolisable energy as fat) for 18 weeks, the concentration of homocysteine in the plasma was significantly raised while that of cysteine was lowered in the high fat as compared to the control diet fed
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, these results reported here show that high fat diet-induced NAFLD in rats causes HHcy and that this is due to down-regulation of hepatic CBS and CGL activity. Thus, HHcy is an early feature of high fat diet-induced NAFLD and is likely to contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with the condition

Background: The mechanism underlying Buerger's disease (BD) is still unknown. Recently, thrombophilic conditions predisposing to a hypercoagulable state have been hypothesized as triggers for BD. The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of the hyperhomocysteinemia and level of the anticardiolipin antibodies, and the role of folic acid on the hyperhomocysteinemia and on the rate of the amputations in the patients with BD. Materials and Methods: In an experimental placebo-controlled double-blinded study, between 2004 and 2010, thirty patients with BD were randomly assigned into two groups (14 patients in a drug group and 16 patients in the placebo group).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study shows hyperhomocysteinemia in BD, and the benefit of folic acid in homocysteine lowering; folic acid could not inhibit major and minor amputation during 6 months of follow-up. Longer follow-up may reveal the benefit of folic acid in these patients. This study emphasized the role of homocysteine in the pathogenesis of BD, especially in smoker patients.

## Human Abstract:
Background and Purpose Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) can show an intravascular Thrombus as a hypointense susceptibility vessel sign (SVS). In this study, we investigated the usefulness of SWI in the detection of an intravascular Thrombus in acute Cardioembolic Stroke by comparing the SVS on SWI to the vessel status on time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Methods We consecutively enrolled patients with Cardioembolic Stroke in the anterior circulation within 3 days from stroke onset. The frequency and location of the SVS on SWI were compared with those of occlusion on MRA. Results One hundred and twenty-two patients were conclusively enrolled in this study.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
SWI is highly useful in defining the location of a thrombus, especially of a single thrombus or of multiple thrombi in distal intracranial arteries, in acute Cardioembolic stroke. In addition, SWI provides information about the thrombus burden and a distal intracranial thrombus, which cannot be obtained from MRA. We believe that SWI can be a useful MR sequence for assessing the thrombus location and burden in acute Cardioembolic stroke

## System Abstract:
Background Myocardial Infarction (AMI) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of CHD in young men and women with Injectable Testosterone (ICH). Methods We performed a prospective cohort analysis of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We assessed the associations between peak systolic blood pressure (MI) and ischemic heart rate (HR). Results: Median age, sex, and all‐cause mortality were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the prevalence of CHD in young men and women with ICH was associated with a higher risk of AMI in the control group. These results suggest that the occurrence of MI in patients with Injectable may be a potential biomarker for the prevention of diabetes.

This study was conducted to examine the association between Testosterone therapy and new Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke events in a series of patients treated at Low T Centers across the United States, consisting of mainly young (mean age = 46), otherwise, healthy men. Electronic medical records were queried between the years 2009 and 2014 to identify patients diagnosed with hypogonadism, MI, and Stroke, as indicated by ICD-9 codes. The incidence of MI and Stroke events was compared to community-based registries. 39,936 patients recruited from 40 Low T Centers across the United States were treated and 19,968 met eligibility criteria for receiving Testosterone treatment.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
It appears from our study that practitioners should not only carefully screen and treat patients with hypogonadism but also carefully and closely monitor them. If patients are given T medications, compliance must be ensured. Only approximately 19,968 of our patients screened met criteria for treatment and were then followed on a protocol requiring regular, repeat clinic visits on a weekly or fortnightly basis for the prime modality of treatment with short acting injections. This strategy may have accounted for the positive outcomes that our study found. In addition, guidelines on treatment of hypogonadism (Endocrine Society, AACE, ISSAM, etc.

The role of diabetes in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes (T1D). A pro-calcific drift of circulating monocytes has been linked to vascular calcification and is marked by the surface expression of osteocalcin (OCN). We studied OCN+ monocytes in a unique population with ≥50 years of T1D, the 50-Year Joslin Medalists (J50M). Methods CD45 bright/CD14+/OCN+ cells in the circulating mononuclear blood cell fraction were quantified by flow cytometry and reported as percentage of CD45 bright cells. Mechanisms were studied by inducing OCN expression in human monocytes in vitro.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, this study supports an association between CVD protection and lower levels of circulating osteogenic cells of myeloid origin in long duration T1D, along with higher HDL-c levels, particularly those of larger sub-particle size. Our data suggest a mechanism for the increased OCN+ monocytes due to oxidized lipids found in diabetes, and that this may be mitigated by HDL. These findings indicate that circulating OCN+ monocytes may be a marker for vascular disease in diabetic patients and may be modified by HDL elevation. Results regarding the regulation of OCN expression on monocytes by OxLDL and HDL through SR-B1 and its relationship with CVD in T1D provide new information on vascular pathophysiology.

## Human Abstract:
Background Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and is common among patients with type 2 diabetes. However, no systematic screening for LVH is currently recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NT-proBNP was superior to 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) for detection of LVH in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods Prospective cross-sectional study comparing diagnostic accuracy of ECG and NT-proBNP for the detection of LVH among patients with type 2 diabetes. Inclusion criteria included having been diagnosed for 5 years and/or on treatment for type 2 diabetes; patients with Stage 3/4 chronic kidney disease and known cardiovascular disease were
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, LVH was highly prevalent in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. ECG was an inadequate test to identify LVH in these patients. NT-proBNP though superior to ECG remains unsuitable as a screening tool to detect LVH in patients with type 2 diabetes. There remains a need for a screening tool to detect LVH in patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care to enhance risk stratification and management

## Human Abstract:
Diabetes has emerged as a major public health problem in India. It is estimated that there were 40 million persons with Diabetes in India in 2007 and this number is predicted to rise to almost 70 million by 2025. The impact of rapid urbanization, industrialization and lifestyle changes has led to an increasing trend in prevalence of Diabetes and its associated complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, vascular diseases (cardiac, cerebral and peripheral) and retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a important cause of avoidable blindness in India. Treatment interventions at early stages of Diabetic retinopathy can reduce burden of blindness due to Diabetic retinopathy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
India needs DR screening programs for early identification of the condition, supported by hierarchical referral structure to provide appropriate timely treatment to reduce the burden of blindness due to diabetes. This shall be done by incorporating and streamlining such models in the existing health infrastructure with public private partnerships and community involvement. Every opportunity of contact with the high-risk cases for DR at any health service facility shall be utilized to identify patients of DR

Association between stroke and risk factors in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge. There is a high risk of Stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions are reviewed.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Stroke prevention in elderly (age ≥75 years) AF patients remains a challenge due to high risk of Stroke, systemic thromboembolism, and bleeding. Despite several important advantages with NOACs, its use in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities is limited (Figure 1). Prior to considering OAC therapy in an elderly frail patient, a comprehensive assessment including the risks and benefits, Stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score), baseline kidney function (CrCl), cognitive status (MMSE), mobility (Activities of Daily Living) and fall risk (Identification of Seniors at Risk score), polypharmacy, body weight/body mass index, nutritional status assessment, and life expectancy (multidimensional prognostic index) should

The effects of Atherosclerosis in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Although cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in rheumatoid arthritis, little is known about the burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in these patients. Methods Using computed tomography, coronary artery calcification was measured in 195 men and women with rheumatoid arthritis aged 45 to 84 years without clinical cardiovascular disease and compared with 1,073 controls without rheumatoid arthritis enrolled in the Baltimore cohort of the Multi-Ethnic Study of atherosclerosis. Results The prevalence of coronary calcification (Agatston score 0) was significantly higher in men, but not women, with rheumatoid arthritis after adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors (prevalence ratio = 1.19; P = 0.012).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we observed a greater prevalence and extent of CAC in RA patients compared with controls even after adjusting for key confounders. In addition, associations were linked to overall RA severity and were of greater magnitude for men and younger patients. Interventional trials targeted at tight control of RA and at aggressive monitoring and management of CV risk factors are needed to identify the most effective means of reducing CV risk in this high-risk population

The effects of COPD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Delayed neutrophil apoptosis may be an important factor in the persistent inflammation associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of neutrophil apoptosis. We determined the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic Bak and anti-aptototic Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 members of the Bcl-2 family in unstimulated peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with mild to moderate COPD and compared these to neutrophils from healthy controls. Methods Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood samples of 47 COPD patients (smokers: N = 24) and 47 healthy controls (smokers: N = 24).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We evaluated associations between Bcl-2 family members mRNA expressions and delayed apoptosis for unstimulated peripheral blood neutrophils from COPD patients. Relative to neutrophils from healthy controls, pro-apoptotic gene Bak mRNA was significantly downregulated in COPD patients ’ neutrophils, whereas anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNA ’ s were significantly upregulated. In addition, Bak mRNA was significantly positively correlated with% predicted FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, while Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNA ’ s were negatively correlated with these parameters. The trend for abnormal mRNA expression for members of the Bcl-2 family was consistent with the decline in lung function in COPD.

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of Mild type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the heart rate of Ischemia/Reperfusion. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 30 Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control group (n = 45), and the controls (CTL). Blood pressure (BP), and nitrogen (IR) were used to collect data on the basis of the ‘ Diabetes ’ s reperfusion. Results: The study was a comprehensive analysis of the publications that was performed to assess the relationship between the expression of ischemia and the underlying mechanisms.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study showed that the expression of Mild and T2DM in the heart rate of Ischemia/Reperfusion. The results indicated that ischemia might be an independent factor for the treatment of Diabetes. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.
## System New Title:
The role of Mild in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Despite clinical studies indicating that diabetic hearts are more sensitive to Ischemia/reperfusion injury, experimental data is contradictory. Although mild diabetes prior to Ischemia/reperfusion may induce a myocardial adaptation, further research is still needed. Nondiabetic Wistar (W) and type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats (16-week-old) underwent 45 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 24 h reperfusion. The plasma glucose level was significantly higher in diabetic rats compared to the nondiabetics. Diabetes mellitus was associated with ventricular hypertrophy and increased interstitial fibrosis. Inducing myocardial infarction increased the glucose levels in diabetic compared to nondiabetic rats.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our data shows that a mild hyperglycaemic environment provides protection to the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury, at least in the early phase of the disease. Lists of genes demonstrating changes in their expression patterns are strongly influenced by the duration and severity of the diabetic state and ischemic insults. In our setup (45 min ischemic time and 24 h reperfusion), the downregulation of apoptotic genes, myocardial proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- α, hypertrophic marker alpha actin-1, and profibrogenic transforming growth factor- β may at least be due to the activation of the prosurvival PI3K/Akt pathway and the upregulation of antioxidants during the acute phase of diabetes.

## Human Abstract:
Background Bromocriptine-QR (a quick-release formulation of Bromocriptine mesylate), a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, is a US Food and Drug Administrration–approved treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A 3070-subject randomized trial demonstrated a significant, 40% reduction in relative risk among Bromocriptine-QR-treated subjects in a prespecified composite cardiovascular (CV) end point that included ischemic-related (myocardial infarction and stroke) and nonischemic-related (hospitalization for unstable angina, congestive heart failure [ CHF ], or revascularization surgery) end points, but did not include cardiovascular death as a component of this composite.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Treatment with bromocriptine-QR reduced the CV death-inclusive composite cardiovascular end point by 39% in T2DM subjects after 1 year of treatment, and this observed relative risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, duration of disease, race, sex, or preexisting CV disease. Furthermore, among such subjects with type 2 diabetes receiving commonly prescribed diabetes therapies, bromocriptine-QR significantly reduced the relative risk for the composite end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (MACE) by 52%

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the atherogenic changes in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Plasma ambulatory blood pressure (BP) ≥30 mg/g (eGFR), and urine levels were measured using radioimmunoassay and RAS. Baseline parameters of diabetic nephropathy (DN) were recorded in the morning Heart Association (UACR) and 24-hour Holter discriminant analysis (ABPM). The primary endpoint was significantly higher in diabetic kidney disease (p < 0. 001) compared to the control group (n = 39).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results indicate that DN is an independent predictor of eGFR in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that the atherogenic changes in the pathogenesis of BP in diabetic kidney disease may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of T2DM.

## Human Abstract:
Background hypertensive patients with reduced blood pressure fall (BPF) at night are at higher risk of cardiovascular events (CVE). Methods We evaluated in hypertensive diabetic patients, if a reduced nocturnal BPF can precedes the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). We followed 70 patients with normal urinary albumin excretion (UAE) for two years. We performed 24-hours ambulatory BP monitoring in baseline and at the end of the study. Results Fourteen (20 %) patients (GI) developed DN (N = 11) and/or CVE (n = 4).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study suggests that an elevation of nocturnal systolic blood pressure and a loss of nocturnal blood pressure fall might precede the development of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular events in Hypertensive normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. Other studies are necessary to confirm these findings

Association between serum uric levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
The risk of cardiovascular complication in a diabetes patient is similar to that in a nondiabetic patient with a history of myocardial infarction. Although intensive control of glycemia achieved by conventional antidiabetic agents decreases microvascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy, no marked effect has been reported on macrovascular complications or all-cause mortality. Evidence from VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE would suggest that glycemic control has little effect on macrovascular outcomes. Moreover, in the case of ACCORD, intensive glycemic control may be associated with an increased risk of mortality. There is sufficient evidence that suggests that postprandial hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes patients.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we reviewed the effects of mitiglinide on postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients. The results of long-term RCTs for the ultimate determination of the cardiovascular effects of mitiglinide in terms of clinical outcomes are awaited; however, the improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia may be crucial to prevent atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Diabetes is associated with a high incidence of macrovascular disease (MVD), including peripheral and coronary artery disease. Circulating soluble-klotho (sklotho) is produced in the kidney and is a putative anti-aging and vasculoprotective hormone. Reduced klotho levels may therefore increase cardiovascular risk in Diabetes. We investigated if sklotho levels are decreased in type 2 Diabetes and associate with MVD in the absence of diabetic nephropathy, and whether hyperglycemia affects renal klotho production in vitro and in vivo. Methods sklotho levels were determined with ELISA in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with and without MVD, and healthy control subjects.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Despite the recent interest in sklotho as a biomarker for renal and cardiovascular disease, our study did not provide a rationale for using sklotho levels as biomarker for MVD in type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects in the absence of nephropathy. Based on our data, a major role of sklotho in the pathophysiology of MVD in diabetes is unlikely

## Human Abstract:
Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker for the clinical diagnosis of bacterial infection that is more specific and earlier than fever, changes in white blood cell count, and blood cultures. Congestive heart failure is an important cause of endotoxin resorption from the intestine, which significantly increases PCT expression in noninfected patients with Heart failure. The diagnostic performance and cut-off value of PCT in patients with bacterial infection complicated by Congestive heart failure needs to be confirmed. Methods A total of 4,698 cases from different cities in China, including those with different classes of Congestive heart failure, bacterial infection, bacterial infection complicated by Heart failure and healthy individuals, were chosen for the diagnostic value analysis of PCT and screening candidate predictors of mortality in subjects with bacterial infection complicated by
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Heart failure is a common factor that interferes with PCT diagnostic value in patients with bacterial infections. The laboratory data of patients with bacterial infections complicated by congestive Heart failure should be analyzed comprehensively, and a complete clinical nursing program should be adjusted. At present, the clinical diagnosis of infections is primarily experience-based, and specific classification criteria are lacking.

## System Abstract:
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Benzofuroxane on Glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 15), and diabetes mellitus (DM). They were randomly assigned to either a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) or placebo (100 mg), or vice versa. The effect of BF-5m on the enzyme was evaluated using the 3- (DC). The expression level of aldose analogue (AR) was measured by the immunoblot of the finger protein kinase (MAPK), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), nitric oxide synthase (Aβ).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results demonstrate that BF-5m on Glucose metabolism and the expression of Benzofuroxane in vitro and in vivo. The present study demonstrated that the inhibition of AR and placebo may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes.

## Human Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of the new aldose reductase inhibitor benzofuroxane derivative 5 (6) - (benzo [ d ] thiazol-2-ylmethoxy) benzofuroxane (BF-5m) on the prolongation of cardiac QT interval and increase of coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) in isolated, high Glucose (33.3 mM D-Glucose) perfused rat hearts. BF-5m was dissolved in the Krebs solution at a final concentration of 0.01 μ M, 0.05 μ M, and 0.1 μ M. 33.3 mM D-Glucose caused a prolongation of the QT interval and increase of CPP up to values of 190 ± 12 ms and 110 ± 8 mmHg with respect to the values of hearts perfused with standard Krebs solution (11.1 mM D-Glucose
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
These results suggest that the new aldose reductase inhibitor benzofuroxane derivative BF-5m supplies cardioprotection from the high Glucose induced QT prolongation and increase of CPP. The mechanism of action involves the increase of SIRT1 protein and activity into the heart tissue, together with the modulation of the expression and activity of its downstream mediators MnSOD and FOXO-1

Role of interferon-gamma release assays in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with advanced HIV infection
## Entities:
tuberculosis; HIV; HIV infection; pulmonary tuberculosis; interferon-gamma
## System Abstract:
Background interferon-gamma (TB) is a serious complication of HIV infection, but the role of pulmonary tuberculosis has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of tuberculosis in patients with advanced HIV infection. Methods A total of 104 consecutive outpatients with CHB were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. The primary outcome was to assess the influence of proinflammatory cytokine levels on CD4 + T cells (DCs). Results The median follow-up duration was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our findings suggest that tuberculosis is an independent prognostic factor for DCs in patients with advanced HIV infection.

Prevalence of tuberculosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) may have a role in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis when evaluating patients for whom standard microbiology has limited sensitivity. Our objective was to examine the accuracy of a commercial IGRA for diagnosis of active tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons. Methods We enrolled HIV-infected patients admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda with cough ≥ 2 weeks. All patients underwent standard medical evaluation. We collected peripheral blood specimens at enrollment and performed a commercial, ELISPOT-based IGRA according to the manufacturer's recommendations. IGRA sensitivity and specificity were determined using mycobacterial culture results as the reference standard.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
An ELISPOT-based IGRA detected a high prevalence of M. TB infection in a population of TB suspects with advanced HIV infection in Uganda. These assays should be considered in sub-Saharan Africa when screening HIV-infected patients for latent tuberculosis infection. However, current ELISPOT-based IGRAs are unlikely to have clinical utility when evaluating active TB suspects. Further research and innovation is needed to identify M. tuberculosis antigens and host markers that are more sensitive and specific for active tuberculosis

## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Trauma-Related Disorders in the salivary glands of Cortisol (HPA) levels in children and adolescents. Methods: A total of 247 adult male Wistar rats were taken preoperatively (n = 16). The primary endpoint was a significant difference in the development of cortisol, and a major depressive disorder (ACTH), and to the control group (MMT) criteria. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (HPLC) assay was used to evaluate the relationship between sexual abuse and hormonal responses.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study showed that Trauma-Related Disorders and hormonal responses in children and adolescents in the salivary glands of the HPA axis in the development of cortisol. Our findings suggest that sexual abuse may be an independent prognostic factor for the treatment of osteoporosis. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of psychopathological in the pathogenesis of Cortisol.

The role of Cortisol in the treatment of children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objectives Inconsistent findings exist for the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with stress related disorders. Recent studies point towards early life stress as a potential modulator. Methods We investigated the impact of childhood sexual abuse on phasic (saliva cortisol reactivity) and tonic (hair cortisol) regulation. Furthermore, we assessed predictors on cortisol accumulation in hair. Women (N = 43) with stress-related disorders underwent a standardized assessment of idiographic adverse and traumatic experiences and psychopathology, while measuring salivary cortisol and, heart rate and blood pressure.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We found distinct Cortisol reactivity in individuals with childhood Sexual Abuse compared to individuals without early Sexual Abuse, supporting the role of environmental programming for the HPA axis early in life [ 13 ]. Further, the current finding of long-term accumulation of Cortisol in hair suggests two major pathways to enhanced accumulation of Cortisol: Both childhood adversities and traumatic stress emerge as crucial factors for long-term Cortisol secretion. Recognition of childhood adversities within discrete diagnostic entities will expand findings (such as distinct neurobiological underpinning). The opposing results show distinct allostatic responses to acute and chronic stress.

Metabolic syndrome and PreDiabetes in Ndokwa Community of Nigeria: Preliminary Study
## Entities:
metabolic syndrome; diabetes; Diabetes; prediabetes; Metabolic syndrome
## System Abstract:
Background Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and PreDiabetes (−) in prediabetes. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional survey was carried out in the Netherlands Study of Nigeria. Participants were divided into two groups: control group (n = 15) and controls (mean age, BMI: DM). The percentages of phosphorylated Glucose and lipid composition were analyzed using the linear regression model.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that MetS and − are associated with a higher risk of T2DM in prediabetes. These findings suggest that waist circumference and lipid metabolism are more effective in the management of patients with Diabetes and in Chinese population. However, prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of these biomarkers in the prevention of Nigeria in community-dwelling. There are no conflicts of interest.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background: Global prevalence of Metabolic syndrome (MS) and Diabetes is increasing, but the reference ranges for MS indices have yet to be established for sub-Saharan African countries. As part of the international research collaboration agenda for PreDiabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study (PACCS), a pilot study was conducted in one of the Ndokwa communities of Nigeria in 2013. Aim: The study was to obtain preliminary indication of prevalence and reference values of MS in the rural communities of a low-mid income country. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four volunteer participants were recruited, after public lectures in high schools and churches in the community.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The results show that prevalence of prediabetes MS may be low in the Ndokwa region of Nigeria by comparison with rural communities elsewhere. However, it appears females are at greater risk than males to develop diabetes; whereas males seem more at risk of MS perhaps due to HDL cholesterol and stricter definition of blood pressure. Relative to ATPIII 2001 criteria, either the IDF2005 European standard may underestimate MS, or the IDF ethnic specific could overestimate the prevalence. It is therefore important to define the criteria to be used

Prevalence and extent of infarct and Microvascular obstruction following different reperfusion therapies in ST-elevation myocardial infarction
## Entities:
Microvascular obstruction; myocardial infarction; infarct; ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction; microvascular obstruction
## System Abstract:
Background Acute reperfusion (MI) is a common condition in elderly patients. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of infarct and Microvascular obstruction in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and to evaluate the risk factors for the treatment of ST elevation therapies. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to deterMIne the relationship between the presence and severity of microvascular obstruction in the left anterior descending coronary artery disease. Patients were divided into three groups: control group (n = 106) and controls (CTL).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the prevalence of infarct and Microvascular obstruction in patients with STEMI elevation was found to be an independent risk factor for the treatment of ST. The results of the present study showed that the presence of microvascular obstruction is associated with the severity of MI in the left anterior descending coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Microvascular obstruction (MVO) describes suboptimal tissue perfusion despite restoration of infarct-related artery flow. There are scarce data on infarct Size (IS) and MVO in relation to the mode and timing of reperfusion. We sought to characterise the prevalence and extent of microvascular injury and IS using Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), in relation to the mode of reperfusion following acute ST-Elevation Myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods CMR infarct characteristics were measured in 94 STEMI patients (age 61.0 ± 13.1 years) at 1.5 T. Seventy-three received reperfusion therapy: primary percutaneous coronary-intervention (PPCI, n = 47); thrombolysis (n = 12); rescue PCI (R-PCI, n = 8), late PCI (n = 6
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
CMR-derived MVO is highly prevalent in STEMI patients not receiving reperfusion therapy. CMR measured MVO is more closely related to ischaemic time than reperfusion therapy in STEMI and may not be a good surrogate marker of reperfusion injury

Association between obesity and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background leptin, an adipocytokine produced by adipose tissue, along with the traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, contributes to the development of cardiovascular complications. At the same time, ethnic features of adipocytokines have been insufficiently investigated, especially among Asians, who have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications compared with Europeans. Aim of study was to investigate the relationship between leptin levels and age, gender, anthropometric parameters, lipid parameters, arterial hypertension (AH), and obesity in the adult population of ethnic Kyrgyz people living in Central Asia. Results In total, 322 ethnic Kyrgyz (145 men, 177 women) aged ≥ 30 years were studied.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Obviously, leptin as a biomarker for body fat reflects a yet unexplored activity of adipocytes and can provide important information regarding the risk of cardiovascular disease [ 58 ]. The results of our study show that leptin is associated with general and abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and IR. At the same time, further large-scale prospective studies are in great demand to better understand and closely investigate the physiological and pathological functions of leptin

Association between prehypertension and Prehypertension in patients with Coronary Heart Disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The results of studies on the association between Prehypertension (blood pressure 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg) and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) remain controversial. Furthermore, it is unclear whether Prehypertension affects the risk of CHD in Asian and Western populations differently. This meta‐analysis evaluated the risk of CHD associated with Prehypertension and its different subgroups. Methods and Results The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for prospective cohort studies with data on Prehypertension and the risk of CHD. Studies were included if they reported multivariate‐adjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs of CHD from Prehypertension.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
After adjusting for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, Prehypertension—even at the low range—is associated with a high risk of CHD. This risk is more pronounced in Western than in Asian patients. These results supported the heterogeneity of target‐organ damage caused by Prehypertension and hypertension among different ethnicities and underscore the importance of prevention of CHD in Western patients with Prehypertension. Future clinical trials are needed to determine whether interventions for Prehypertension have different effects on risk of CHD in different ethnicities

## System Abstract:
Background Obesity is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on serum Lipocalin-2 levels in overweight and obese women. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted to examine the effect of BMI on body mass index (polycystic ovary syndrome) and insulin sensitivity (ALT). Body blood pressure (BP) were used to determine the relative risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Results Obese patients were divided into four groups (n = 42), and healthy controls.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that obesity on serum Lipocalin-2 levels in overweight and obese women are not associated with a higher risk of insulin sensitivity. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of BMI on the prevention of CVD.

Association between serum polycystic ovary syndrome and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Lipocalin-2 is a novel adipokine that appears to play a role in the development of insulin resistance. Serum Lipocalin-2 levels are elevated in obese patients. obesity and insulin resistance are cardinal characteristics of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, there are limited data on serum Lipocalin-2 levels in patients with PCOS. The aim of the present study was to assess serum Lipocalin-2 levels in PCOS. Methods We studied 200 patients with PCOS and 50 healthy female volunteers. Results Serum Lipocalin-2 levels were slightly higher in women with PCOS compared with controls (65.4 +/- 34.3 vs. 60.3 +/- 26.0 ng/ml, respectively) but this difference did not reach statistical significance.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our findings suggest that PCOS is not associated with significant changes in serum lipocalin-2 levels. On the other hand, obese patients have elevated serum lipocalin-2 levels, regardless of the presence of PCOS. The increased serum lipocalin-2 levels in overweight and obese patients with PCOS potentially represent a useful marker of IR

## System Abstract:
Background episodic collapse is a rare cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with adipose tissue. We report a case of a 33-year-old male who presented with a history of sudden onset of palpitations and dyspnea. The patient was diagnosed with collapse of the right upper quadrant of breath. Ultrasound was administered to the emergency department with a diagnosis of chest pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to distinguish the severity of the left ventricular dilatation and the normalized ratio of cardiomyopathy.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
We report a rare case of a patient presenting with adipose tissue with a history of chest pain and dyspnea in patients with collapse. We believe that episodic collapse may be a cause of morbidity and mortality in the treatment of cardiomyopathy.

Collapse and safety of cardiomyopathy in patients with episodic collapse: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
A 15-year-old Clydesdale cross gelding was investigated and managed over a 2-year period for intermittent collapse. The horse presented initially after an observed episode of collapse at rest, and had a resting tachycardia, elevated Cardiac Troponin I and polycythaemia. Multiple dysrhythmias were detected on telemetric electrocardiography. Vital parameters, cardiac rhythm and red cell count returned to reference range with prolonged rest but further resting syncopal episodes were observed, and due to safety concerns and limited treatment options the horse was euthanased. Post mortem evaluation identified extensive infiltration and replacement of right and left ventricular myocardial fibres with adipose and fibrous tissue, consistent with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Episodes of collapse are rare in the horse and evidence based literature is limited. The aetiology of the collapse is frequently difficult to establish as it is complicated by the intermittent nature of the clinical signs. In the case series by Lyle et al. [ 16 ] only 44% of horses had a definite diagnosis. The case reported here was classified as syncopal due to the progression of clinical signs to loss of postural tone and full loss of consciousness together with post mortem findings. Differential diagnosis for syncopal collapse can be broadly divided in to cardiac, neurally mediated and miscellaneous causes (volume depletion, endotoxaemia, drugs, dysautonomia) [ 15

Efficacy and safety of fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Despite the known risk of diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis, less is known about whether diabetes causes an altered cardiac phenotype independent of coronary atherosclerosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ), a versatile regulator of metabolic homeostasis, may be a potential therapeutic target. Herein we investigated the effectiveness of Telmisartan, a unique angiotensin receptor blocker that increases PPARδ expression, in improving left ventricular remodeling in diabetic humans and rats. Methods In this longitudinal, prospective study, we enrolled 15 diabetic patients receiving Telmisartan (20 mg/day) for 12 weeks. After treatment, strain was measured and compared with the baseline value.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
These results indicate that Telmisartan activates endogenous PPARδ and may prevent CTGF/MMP9-induced fibrotic changes by upregulating STAT3 expression in a hyperglycemic environment. These findings potentially elucidate the beneficial effects of Telmisartan on LV structural and functional restoration

## System Abstract:
Background ISL-1 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AML) is an important determinant of cancer cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a combination of a p-STAT3/p-c-Jun/ISL-1 complex on lymphoma and its role in tumor progression. Methods Cells were screened for mRNA and protein expression in real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Samples were collected from the same and twelve weeks. The primary outcome was the first line of the disease. Results In the present work, we found that the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (p < 0. 001) was detected in a dose-dependent manner.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the combination of a single nucleotide polymorphism was significantly correlated with the presence of lymphoma and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the treatment of AML may be useful in the pathogenesis of tumor progression.

## Human Abstract:
Background Insulin enhancer binding protein-1 (ISL-1), a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, is essential for the heart, motor neuron and pancreas development. Recently, ISL-1 has been found in some types of human cancers. However, how ISL-1 exerts the role in tumor development is not clear. Methods and results The expression of ISL-1 was assessed in 211 human lymphoma samples and 23 normal lymph node samples. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated a markedly higher expression of ISL-1 in 75% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) samples compared with that in normal lymph nodes or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) samples.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Overall, in this study, we extend the knowledge about the crucial roles of ISL-1. Our findings document that ISL-1 is highly expressed in NHL and plays an oncogenic role in lymphomagenesis. Aberrant ISL-1 could stimulate cell proliferation and xenograft growth by activating c-Myc transcription. Moreover, JNK and JAK/STAT pathways contribute to ISL-1 dysregulation. Our study identifies a specific and novel function of ISL-1 in NHL development and suggests that the ISL-1 suppression represents a potential target for NHL treatment

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE Sulfonylureas have historically been analyzed as a medication class, which may be inappropriate given the differences in properties inherent to the individual sulfonylureas (hypoglycemic risk, sulfonylurea receptor selectivity, and effects on myocardial ischemic preconditioning). The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of individual sulfonylureas and the risk of overall mortality in a large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an academic health center enterprise-wide electronic health record (EHR) system to identify 11,141 patients with type 2 diabetes (4,279 initiators of monotherapy with glyburide, 4,325 initiators of monotherapy with glipizide, and 2,537 initiators of monotherapy with glimepiride), ≥18 years of age with and without a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and not on insulin or a noninsulin injectable at
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in the risk of overall mortality among the various treatment options, suggesting that overall mortality is not substantially influenced by the choice of sulfonylurea. However, in the subanalysis of patients with documented CAD, a trend toward an increased overall mortality risk with glyburide versus glimepiride (hazard ratio 1.36 [ 95% CI 0.96–1.91 ]), and surprisingly a trend toward an increased risk of mortality with the SUR1-specific sulfonylurea glipizide versus glimepiride (1.39 [ 0.99–1.96 ]), were observed, suggesting that glimepiride may be the preferred sulfonylurea in those with underlying CAD.

## Human Abstract:
Introduction We analyzed phase 3 trial data of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and Dasabuvir (3D) ± ribavirin (RBV) in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients to investigate the impact of 3D ± RBV on renal,  cardiovascular and metabolic extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs), including persistency 52 weeks post treatment and differential impact by EHM disease severity. Methods Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting triglyceride and fasting glucose values from clinical trials were used to assess renal,  cardiovascular and metabolic EHMs, respectively. Two placebo-controlled trials were used to study the effect of treatment, while the pooled sample of treated patients was used to study the persistency and differential effect of treatment by baseline EHM disease severity, as defined by baseline values of respective EHM
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this post hoc analysis including large study populations, treatment with 3D ± RBV improved cardiovascular, metabolic and renal EHMs, especially in patients with elevated triglycerides, pre-diabetes/diabetes and CKD stage 2 and 3. CKD stage 4 and 5 patients had a stable eGFR during and post-treatment period. These positive effects of treatment on EHMs persisted at least 1 year post completion of treatment

Effects of Rheumatoid cachexia on the risk of cachexia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) independent of tRAditional risk factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the associations between diet, body composition, lipids and atheroprotective natuRAl antibodies against phosphorylcholine (anti-PC) in patients with RA. Methods A total of 80 RA patients (76% women), mean age (standard deviation (SD) ) 61.4 (12) years and median disease duRAtion of 6 years, were assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), fatty acid profile in adipose tissue and whole-body dual energy x RAy absorptiometry (DXA).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In our cohort of RA patients with low disease activity and BMI in the upper reference RAnge every fourth to fifth patient had Rheumatoid cachexia, a condition that was not associated with the observed increased intake of fatty acids. Rheumatoid cachexia defined as FFMI below the 25th percentile and FMI above the 50th percentile was associated with risk factors for CVD, including RAised cholesterol and LDL and also decreased levels of the atheroprotective marker anti-PC as well as a high frequency of hypertension. We thus propose this definition of Rheumatoid cachexia to be used, as it verifies that it is associated with increased morbidity.

## Human Abstract:
Elderly patients are susceptible to sepsis. LPS induced myocardial injury is a widely used animal model to assess sepsis induced cardiac dysfunction. The age dependent mechanisms behind sepsis susceptibility were not studied. We analyzed age associated changes to cardiac function, cell death, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy in LPS induced myocardial injury. Both young and aged C57BL/6 mice were used for LPS administration. The results demonstrated that LPS induced more cardiac injury (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin I, and cardiac myosin-light chains 1), cardiac dysfunction (left ventricular inner dimension, LVID, and ejection fraction (EF) ), cell death, inflammation, and oxidative stress in aged mice compared to young
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We demonstrated for the first time that TFEB mediated autophagy played critical role in age dependent LPS induced myocardial Toxicity which led to cardiac dysfunction. In aging heart, the translocation of TFEB to nucleus was greatly impaired and the autophagy machinery was impaired. Due to impaired autophagy, the basal level of inflammation and oxidative stress is higher in aging heart, which was further escalated in response to LPS

Calcium Overload Accelerates Phosphate-Induced Vascular calcification Via Pit-1, but not the Calcium-Sensing Receptor
## Entities:
Vascular Calcification; Vascular calcification; Calcium; calcification; Phosphate
## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Calcium Overload on the formation of Phosphate (PUFA) in the presence of propofol. Methods: In the present work, we examined the effect of the supplementation on the left ventricular mass in the aorta of the Calcium-Sensing receptor (KO) mice. Results: The results showed that there was no significant difference in the lower limb density (P < 0. 001), which was found to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results indicate that Calcium Overload on the formation of propofol in the presence of KO in the aorta of the lower ventricular mass. The supplementation of PUFA in the left ventricle density, the addition of the Phosphate is the most important factor for the treatment of CVD. However, further studies are needed to verify the effects of these drugs in humans.
## System New Title:
The role of calcification in the treatment of Phosphate: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Aim: Vascular calcification (VC) is a risk factor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD–mineral and bone metabolism disorder is an important problem in patients with renal failure. Abnormal levels of serum Phosphate and Calcium affect CKD–mineral and bone metabolism disorder and contribute to bone disease, VC, and cardiovascular disease. Hypercalcemia is a contributing factor in progression of VC in patients with CKD. However, the mechanisms of how Calcium promotes intracellular calcification are still unclear. This study aimed to examine the mechanisms underlying Calcium-induced calcification in a rat aortic tissue culture model.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our study shows that the amount of Pit-1 protein in aortic rings that are cultured with HPi+HiCa is greater than that in those cultured in only HPi. Our results indicate that exposure to HPi+HiCa accelerates aortic medial calcification through Pit-1, but not CaSR

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE —Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for microvascular complications and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study tested the LDL cholesterol–lowering agent Colesevelam HCl (Colesevelam) as a potential novel treatment for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea-based therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was carried out between August 2004 and August 2006 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Colesevelam for reducing A1C in adults with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate (A1C 7.5–9.5 %) with existing sulfonylurea monotherapy or sulfonylurea in combination with additional oral antidiabetes
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study investigated the glucose-lowering effect of Colesevelam in patients with type 2 diabetes when added to an existing regimen of sulfonylurea, alone or in combination with additional oral antidiabetes agents. Colesevelam resulted in a significant mean A1C reduction (0.54 %) by week 26 in the total population, with the sulfonylurea monotherapy and sulfonylurea combination therapy cohorts reporting a significant reduction at week 26 as well (0.79 and 0.42% , respectively). While the magnitude of A1C reduction may appear modest, it is similar to the observed effect from another study in which a new antidiabetes agent was combined with a sulfonylurea in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes (16

## System Abstract:
Background embolic events endocarditis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of SEI (ACS) -associated amyloidosis (PD) in the general population. Methods: A total of 452 patients admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, Tehran, Iran, and December 2016 were included. The patient was diagnosed with a history of venous thromboembolism (SD). The primary endpoint was the first time of the diagnosis and progression of the disease.
## System Conclusion and Future work:

A Randomized Controlled Trial of SEI lymphomas in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Embolic events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with infective endocarditis. We analyzed the database of the prospective cohort study SEI in order to identify factors associated with the occurrence of embolic events and to develop a scoring system for the assessment of the risk of embolism. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 1456 episodes of infective endocarditis from the multicenter study SEI. Predictors of embolism were identified. Risk factors identified at multivariate analysis as predictive of embolism in left-sided endocarditis, were used for the development of a risk score: 1 point was assigned to each risk factor (total risk score range: minimum 0 points; maximum 2 points).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Embolism occurs early in the course of IE; the steep decline of the risk of embolization immediately after antibiotics initiation allows only a narrow time window for the surgical prophylaxis of embolic complications. In this challenging clinical context, the simple score system described in the present study, if externally validated, might contribute to a timely and individualized assessment of the embolic risk

## Entities:
MI; Nocturnal hypoxemia; apnea; hypoxemia; sleep apnea; myocardial infarction; Myocardial Infarction; Obstructive sleep apnea; Nocturnal Hypoxemia
## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Obstructive apnea (OSA) and Myocardial Infarction (HC). Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the National Health Insurance Research Hospital from a tertiary care center. Patients were divided into two groups: control group (n = 53), and obese subjects. The primary endpoint was the association between the severity and clinical variables. Results: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly higher in the morning and evening of the left coronary artery (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that OSA and HC apnea are associated with the severity of LVEF in the morning and evening. The relationship between Obstructive and GERD were significantly higher in the left coronary artery than in the absence of obese subjects. However, it is important to confirm the role of these biomarkers in the management of patients.

Association between myocardial infarction and cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases including Myocardial Infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OSA on prognosis after MI, and to deterMIne which specific measures of OSA severity best predicted outcomes. Methods and Results We performed a prospective study, in which 112 patients without a prior diagnosis of sleep apnea underwent comprehensive polysomnography within a median of 7 days after MI. Patients were followed up at 6‐monthly intervals (±2 weeks) for a total of 48 months.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In stable patients after MI, untreated OSA is associated with increased risk of adverse events, and Nocturnal hypoxeMIa is an independent predictor of MACE. Despite the high prevalence of OSA in patients with MI, it may not be feasible to conduct full‐attended PSGs routinely. Overnight oximetry may be a more practical cost‐effective alternative approach to stratify risk of MACE after MI, and to identify those who warrant a full sleep study and who may potentially benefit from intervention

Association between SCD and risk factors in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Recent findings suggest that Atrial Fibrillation is associated with Sudden Cardiac death (SCD). We examined the incidence, characteristics, and factors associated with SCD in patients with Atrial Fibrillation. Methods and Results SCD was defined as witnessed death ≤60 minutes from the onset of new symptoms or unwitnessed death 1 to 24 hours after being observed alive, without another known cause of death. Predictors of SCD were examined using multivariate competing risks models. Over 2.8 years (median), 2349 patients died (40.5 per 1000 patient‐years), of which 1668 (71 %) were cardiovascular deaths.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
SCD is the most common cause of cardiovascular death in patients with AF and has several distinct predictors, some of which are modifiable. These findings may be considered in planning treatment strategies and future research for patients with AF

Fibrosis and risk factors in patients with Fibulin-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
fibrosis is an oMInous pathological process in failing myocardium, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. We recently reported that loss of an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, Fibulin-2, protected against ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI) in association with absence of activation of transforMIng groWTh factor (TGF) -β signaling and suppressed up-regulation of ECM protein expression during myocardial remodeling. Here, we investigated a role of Fibulin-2 in the development of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by continuous pressor-dosage of Ang II infusion. Both wild type (WT) and Fibulin-2 null (Fbln2KO) MIce developed comparable hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy by Ang II infusion.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our current study suggests that Fibulin-2 is essential for Ang II-induced myocardial fibrosis by mediating TGF-β signaling. Without Fibulin-2, TGF-β autoinduction does not occur. Targeting Fibulin-2 may have potential therapeutic indication not only by preventing TGF-β-mediated myocardial fibrosis, thus attenuating the progression of heart failure in humans, but also by enhancing expression of natriuretic peptides that have antifibrotic properties 43. Further investigation is required to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms that involve Fibulin-2

## System Abstract:
Background bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a common cause of death in the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of the prevention. Methods A pilot model was conducted in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (CD) and the control group (n = 7). The subjects were divided into two groups: Group A, T1, and oral glucose tolerance test.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that azithromycin in the prevention of patients with acute respiratory distress in the treatment of the gastrointestinal tract is safe and well-tolerated. The efficacy of the safety and tolerability of the primary outcome is not effective in the management of the disease. However, it is necessary to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background azithromycin reduces the severity of illness in patients with inflammatory lung disease such as cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a pulmonary disorder which causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants. BPD is pathologically characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and impaired alveolar development. The purpose of this study was to obtain pilot data on the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic azithromycin in reducing the incidence and severity of BPD in an extremely low birth weight (≤ 1000 grams) population. Methods Infants ≤ 1000 g birth weight admitted to the University of Kentucky Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (level III, regional referral center) from 9/1/02-6/30/03 were eligible for this pilot
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our pilot study showed that infants treated with Azithromycin prophylaxis were less likely to receive postnatal steroids. Survivors also had shortened duration of mechanical ventilation, and shortened hospital stay when receiving Azithromycin prophylaxis. Side effects of Azithromycin prophylaxis were minimal and similar to placebo. Further studies are needed before Azithromycin can be recommended for routine therapy in the treatment of BPD

## System Abstract:
Abstract Rationale: Aliskiren is a rare disease characterized by a variety of hypertensive disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of aliskiren, pharmacodynamics, and clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension. Methods We reviewed the medical records of ambulatory blood pressure (BP), kinetics, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the treatment of corneal tissue. We performed a retrospective review of the English literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. The primary outcome was established by using a scoring system.

Prognostic value of Aliskiren in patients with hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
The importance of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in diseases such as hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure has long ago been recognized. It has also been established that inhibition of RAAS, using inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), is an effective way to intervene with the pathogenesis of these disorders. Renin inhibitors block the RAAS at the highest level, at its origin, and might thus offer a new exciting approach for pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension. Aliskiren is the first in a new class of orally active, non-peptide, low molecular weight Renin inhibitors, and so far the only Renin inhibitor that has progressed to phase III clinical
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
aliskiren offers a promising new approach to the blockade of the RAS. It is the first representative of a new class of non-peptide, low molecular weight, orally active transition-state renin inhibitors. Its high potency against human renin compensates for its relatively low absolute bioavailability, its long half-life makes it suitable for once daily administration. aliskiren is effective in reducing blood pressure and is well tolerated, with a side-effect profile similar to placebo or ARBs. It exhibits synergistic effects when combined with drugs that lead to a reactive increase in the plasma renin activity, such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARB.

Association between primary hypothyroidism and Metabolic syndrome and the role of C reactive protein: a cross–sectional study from South India
## Entities:
primary hypothyroidism; metabolic syndrome; Hypothyroidism; hypothyroidism; Metabolic syndrome
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between primary hypothyroidism and Metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: This was a prospective, observational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Anthropometric was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Results The mean difference was found to be associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic disease (CHD) and overall survival (OS). Furthermore, the association between the levels of C and MS were also investigated.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study indicate that the levels of C and MS are associated with increased risk of MetS. The association between primary hypothyroidism and Metabolic syndrome were found to be an independent predictor of CHD and OS. However, these findings are needed to confirm the role of the relationship between the prevalence of diabetes. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease and progression of these patients. Nil. There are no conflicts of interest.

Association between hypothyroidism and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background hypothyroidism (sub-clinical and overt) and Metabolic syndrome are recognized risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This study is an effort to identify the proposed association between these two disease entities and the risk factors involved in this association. Methods A cross – sectional study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in Chennai city, South India. 420 patients with Metabolic syndrome (NCEP – ATP III criteria) were included in the study group. 406 appropriately age and sex matched controls having no features of Metabolic syndrome (0 out of the 5 criteria) were compared with the study group.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Sub-clinical and overt Hypothyroidism is significantly associated with Metabolic syndrome patients. Females have an increased risk of this association. Hence it will be worthwhile to screen female Metabolic syndrome patients for Hypothyroidism. MetS patients with SCH may have systemic inflammation and conversely, MetS patients with raised HsCRP are at risk for SCH. Whether this triple association between MetS, Hypothyroidism, systemic inflammation will translate into compounded cardiovascular risk is yet to be determined. Controversy prevails with respect to benefits of thyroxine replacement in sub-clinical Hypothyroidism. Whether Metabolic syndrome patients with sub-clinical Hypothyroidism will benefit from thyroxine replacement is for future randomized trials to answer

## System Abstract:
Background Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in HCM patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between LGE and myocardial fibrosis. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the left ventricle, a right ventricular lobe (LVEF), and to identify predictors of myocardial infarction (CMR). Results The median follow-up time (r = 0. 001) was found to be a sign of the lower limbs (p < 0. 05).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that LGE is associated with a higher risk of myocardial fibrosis and fibrosis in patients with MRI.

The association between fibrosis and risk factors in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The presence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with worse clinical outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences can detect regional, but not diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Post-contrast T 1 mapping is an emerging CMR technique that may enable the non-invasive evaluation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in HCM. The purpose of this study was to non-invasively detect and quantify diffuse myocardial fibrosis in HCM with CMR and examine its relationship to diastolic performance. Methods We performed CMR on 76 patients - 51 with asymmetric septal hypertrophy due to HCM and 25 healthy controls.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Using CMR post-contrast T 1 mapping, this study has demonstrated that patients with HCM have reduced post-contrast myocardial T 1 times, consistent with the presence of diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, the independent association of post-contrast myocardial T 1 time with estimated LV filling pressure (E/e ’) suggests a mechanistic link between altered myocardial composition and function. The non-invasive detection of diffuse fibrosis, in combination with standard LGE sequences to identify dense regional fibrosis, now allows a comprehensive evaluation of patterns of fibrosis in this condition. Further research utilizing this technique may enhance our understanding of the relationships between HCM genetic mutations, abnormal myocardial structure and function, and risk stratification and may facilitate the future development of

## System Abstract:
Background Anemia (IDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the United States. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of beta-blockade in the treatment of Iron overload in patients with Iron deficiency. Methods: Wild-type and arterial blood samples were obtained in the left ventricle, and the rabbits were randomly assigned to receive either oral prednisolone (DFX) or placebo (n = 10) or saline (PR). The primary endpoint was a significant difference in the remodeling of the disease.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that beta-blockade in patients with Iron deficiency is a potential therapeutic option for Iron treatment.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with chronic kidney disease: a case report.


## Human Abstract:
Background Iron deficiency (ID) results in ventricular hypertrophy, believed to involve sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesized that with ID 1) intravenous norepinephrine would alter heart rate (HR) and contractility, 2) abdominal aorta would be larger and more distensible, and 3) the beta-blocker propanolol would reduce hypertrophy. Methods 1) 30 CD rats were fed an ID or replete diet for 1 week or 1 month. norepinephrine was infused via jugular vein; pressure was monitored at carotid artery. Saline infusions were used as a control. The pressure trace was analyzed for HR, contractility, systolic and diastolic pressures.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac and vascular responses associated with the development of Iron deficiency. In our first experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the Iron deficient heart would display an altered response to norepinephrine, the sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter. In contrast to what has been seen with most cardiac disease states, we found that the Iron deficient heart is hyper-sensitive to norepinephrine. This suggests an adaptive compensation to the depletion of the neurotransmitter stores in the heart sympathetic nerve terminals. Further, we found that contractility was enhanced, but heart rate was not.

## System Abstract:
Background Susceptibility (COPD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (LC). It has been suggested that the use of corticosteroids in non-small-cell lung cancer is a consequence of a subset of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of IREB2 on the loci of the lung and the underlying mechanism in the context of this paper. Methods We reviewed the medical records of the out-patient department (n = 44), and to investigate the relationship between serum levels of the upper airway Inventory (BDI), and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan.

## Human Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies have identified loci at 15q25 (IREB2) and 4q22 (FAM13A), associated with lung cancer (LC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of our research was to determine the association of IREB2 and FAM13A SNPs with LC and severe/very severe COPD patients. We examined IREB2 variants (rs2568494, rs2656069, rs10851906, rs13180) and FAM13A (rs1903003, rs7671167, rs2869967) among 1.141 participants (468 LC, 149 COPD, 524 smoking controls). The frequency of the minor IREB2 rs2568494 AA genotype, was higher in LC vs controls (P = 0.0081, OR = 1.682).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We confirmed the association between IREB2 gene and lung cancer and between FAM13A gene and COPD in Polish patients. Further studies are required to elucidate the functional role of these variants, which may have an impact on lung disease susceptibility

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used a population-based cohort study to assess the likelihood of a Risk factor (< 6. 1 %) in the general population. RESULTS The prevalence of a free event was estimated by the National Health Insurance Research Database, and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed a significant increase in 95% of all patients.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the prevalence of a free event was associated with the risk of CVD in the general population. These results suggest that CKD is an important factor for the management of patients with T2DM. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE Individuals at high risk for chronic cardiometabolic disease (cardiovascular disease [ CVD ], type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [ CKD ]) share many risk factors and would benefit from early intervention. We developed a nonlaboratory-based risk-assessment tool for identification of people at high cardiometabolic disease risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data of three population-based cohorts from different regions of the Netherlands were merged. Participants were 2,840 men and 3,940 women, white, aged 28–85 years, free from CVD, type 2 diabetes, and CKD diagnosis at baseline. The outcome was developing cardiometabolic disease during 7 years follow-up.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In the current study, we developed and validated a nonlaboratory-based risk prediction tool for primary prevention purposes that can identify people who are currently free from disease but at high risk of future CVD, type 2 diabetes, and/or CKD. The present score is the first predicting multiple chronic cardiometabolic disease outcomes and, as such, is a novelty in health care. The performance of the risk questionnaire was similar to existing nonlaboratory-based risk scores that predict the separate diseases. Prior to this study, no score was available that predicted the combined outcome of CVD, type 2 diabetes, and/or CKD.

## Human Abstract:
Background Myocardial Infarction causes irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes and may lead to loss of ventricular function, morbidity and mortality. Infarct size is a major prognostic factor and reduction of Infarct size has therefore been an important objective of strategies to improve outcomes. In experimental studies, glucagon-like peptide 1 and EXenatide, a long acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, a novel drug introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, reduced Infarct size after Myocardial Infarction by activating pro-survival pathways and by increasing metabolic efficiency. Methods The EXAMI trial is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial, designed to evaluate clinical outcome of EXenatide infusion on top of standard treatment, in patients with an acute Myocardial Infarction, successfully treated with primary percutaneous coronary

## Human Abstract:
Background There is accumulating evidence for an increased cardiovascular burden in inflammatory arthritis, but the true magnitude of this cardiovascular burden is still debated. We sought to determine the prevalence rate of non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) in inflammatory arthritis, diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis (non-systemic inflammatory comparator) compared to controls, in primary care. Methods Data on CVD morbidity (ICPC codes K75 (myocardial infarction), K89 (transient ischemic attack), and/or K90 (stroke/cerebrovascular accident) ) from patients with inflammatory arthritis (n = 1,518), diabetes mellitus (n = 11,959), osteoarthritis (n = 4,040) and controls (n = 158,439) were used from the Netherlands Information Network of General Practice (LINH), a large nationally representative primary care based
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating an increased prevalence rate of CVD in inflammatory arthritis to levels broadly similar to diabetes mellitus in a representative primary care population. The lack of excess CVD in osteoarthritis further suggests that systemic inflammatory load appears critical to the CVD burden in inflammatory arthritis and indirectly underscores the importance of adequate control of disease activity in inflammatory arthritis patients to lower CVD risk

Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant risk factor for Ischemic strokes, and making a robust risk stratification scheme would be important. Few studies have examined whether nonlinear dynamics of the heart rate could predict Ischemic strokes in AF. We examined whether a novel complexity measurement of the heart rate variability called multiscale entropy (MSE) was a useful risk stratification measure of Ischemic strokes in patients with permanent AF. Methods and Results We examined 173 consecutive patients (age 69±11 years) with permanent AF who underwent 24-hour Holter electrocardiography from April 2005 to December 2006.

## Human Abstract:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multifaceted condition that cannot be fully described by the severity of airway obstruction. The limitations of spirometry and clinical history have prompted researchers to investigate a multitude of surrogate biomarkers of disease for the assessment of patients, prediction of risk, and guidance of treatment. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of observations for a selection of recently investigated pulmonary inflammatory biomarkers (Surfactant protein D (SP-D), Club cell protein 16 (CC-16), and Pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC/CCL-18) ) and systemic inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP) and Fibrinogen) with COPD.

Chronic pain, Depression and cardiovascular disease linked through a shared genetic predisposition: Analysis of a family-based cohort and twin study
## Entities:
depression; Depression; Chronic pain; cardiovascular disease; chronic pain; genetic predisposition
## System Abstract:
Background Chronic pain and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been associated with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between depression and Depression. Methods A longitudinal analysis was conducted in a Norwegian cohort of patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (n = 261), and to investigate the association between depressive and symptoms of the disease. We assessed the associations between groups and their parents in a sample of participants. The primary endpoint was a significant difference in serum levels of life (HRQoL) and total capacity (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that depression and CVD levels are associated with increased risk of Depression in patients with rheumatoid. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Prevalence of Depression and anxiety in patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study.


## Human Abstract:
Background Depression and chronic pain are the two most important causes of disability (Global Burden of Disease Study 2013). They occur together more frequently than expected and both conditions have been shown to be co-morbid with cardiovascular disease. Although shared socio-demographic risk factors (e.g. gender, deprivation) might explain the co-morbidity of these three conditions, we hypothesised that these three long-term, highly prevalent conditions co-occur and may be due to shared familial risk, and/or genetic factors. Methods and findings We employed three different study designs in two independent cohorts, namely Generation Scotland and TwinsUK, having standardised, validated questionnaire data on the three traits of interest.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We have shown that Chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, and Depression coexist in individuals and across families even after adjusting for known environmental risk factors. The presence of one trait significantly increases the risk of manifesting another, both in siblings and twins. Pairs of traits offer even higher risks of manifesting the third. Twin modelling shows that pairs of traits have shared genetic predisposition which would account for their co-occurrence. Future work should aim to identify the genetic variants involved, as better understanding of the biological pathways will clarify the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms as well as having the potential to provide novel targets for intervention

Association between insulin receptor substrate-1 polymorphisms and high platelet reactivity with clopidogrel therapy in coronary artery disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
## Entities:
diabetes; insulin receptor substrate-1; coronary artery disease; clopidogrel; type 2 diabetes mellitus
## System Abstract:
Background insulin receptor substrate-1 (CAD) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent necrosis factor beta (SGLT2) inhibitors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between DM1 and high mortality rates in coronary artery disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (PAI-1). We examined whether the relationship between polymorphisms and ADMA levels of clopidogrel was assessed using a random-effects polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Cox regression analyses.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that DM1 and high mortality levels were independently associated with increased risk of clopidogrel in coronary artery disease patients with T2DM. The association between polymorphisms and ADMA genotype were not correlated with the severity of CAD. The results of the present findings suggest that the relationship between TG and PAI-1 may be useful in the pathogenesis of CVD.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The mechanisms leading to the high on-treatment platelet reactivity in diabetes patients are not fully elucidated. The genetic factors may be associated with the diminished antiplatelet efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy. We investigated the possible association between insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) polymorphisms and high platelet reactivity in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods A total of 674 CAD patients with T2DM were enrolled in this study. Platelet aggregation and platelet activation were assessed with light transmission aggregometry and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Participants were divided into high platelet reactivity (HPR) group and non-HPR group according to their maximal platelet aggregation.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Variant rs13431554 in the IRS-1 gene is associated with a hyperreactive platelet phenotype and a sub-optimal response to antiplatelet drug in CAD patients with T2DM. There is an association between the G allele of rs13431554 and the increased platelet aggregation and activity. Further validations using larger sample sizes of diverse ethnic populations and functional evaluations are warranted

## Human Abstract:
TRAIL (tumor Necrosis Factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is an endogenous ligand, which plays role in immune surveillance and anti-tumor immunity. It has ability to selectively kill tumor cells showing no toxicity to normal cells. We tested the apoptotic and cytotoxic activities of Xanthohumol, a prenylated chalcone found in Humulus lupulus on androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (LNCaP) in combination with TRAIL. Cytotoxicity was measured by 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH). The expression of death receptors (DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2) and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
xanthohumol supports apoptotic and cytotoxic activities of TRAIL on prostate LNCaP cancer cells. This prenylated chalcone sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through modulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The potential apoptotic mechanism, after application of TRAIL in combination with xanthohumol, is most likely associated with the activation of caspases-3, -8, -9, with the activation of Bid, with the increase of the expression of Bax, the decrease of the expression of Bcl-xL, and also with the decrease of mitochondrial potential in LNCaP cells. xanthohumol sensitizes LNCaP cancer cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL and, therefore, it can enhance the natural mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity

## System Abstract:
Background Pancreatic cancer is the most common type of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between weight loss and pulmonary function in patients with cachexia. Methods A retrospective cohort review was performed to assess the association between the levels of IL-6 and body mass index (BMI) in the presence and absence of a primary endpoint. Results The mean age of 51 years was found to be associated with increased adiposity and overall survival (OS) compared to controls (P < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that weight loss and pulmonary function are associated with a higher risk of IL-6 in patients with cachexia. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between serum levels and risk factors in patients with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Dramatic weight loss is an often underestimated symptom in Pancreatic cancer patients. cachexia- defined as an unintended loss of stable weight exceeding 10% – is present in up to 80% of patients with cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and has a significant influence on survival. The aim of the study was to show the multiple systemic effects of cachexia in Pancreatic cancer patients, in terms of resection rate, effects on pulmonary function, amount of fat and muscle tissue, as well as changes in laboratory parameters. Methods In patients with Pancreatic cancer, clinical appearance was documented, including the amount of weight loss.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we showed that nearly 40% of patients with pancreatic cancer who present for tumour resection suffer from weight loss of 10% or more of their stable pre-illness weight. Due to metastases to the liver and/or peritoneal cavity, the resection rate is significantly reduced in patients with cachexia. A dramatic weight loss in a patient with pancreatic cancer may hint at a more progressed or more aggressive tumour. A weight loss of 10% had a significant systemic effect, which was not as strong as for a 5% weight loss; the resection rate was also significantly worse when weight loss exceeded 5% , but the nutritional status showed significant differences only when the division parameter was weight loss of 10

Mitochondrial Reactive oxygen Species Mediate Cardiac Structural, Functional, and Mitochondrial Consequences of Diet‐Induced metabolic heart disease
## Entities:
Metabolic Heart Disease; oxygen; reactive oxygen species; Reactive Oxygen Species; metabolic heart disease
## System Abstract:
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is the most common type of mitochondrial dysfunction, and the mechanism of action of reactive oxygen species is unknown. The aim of this in-vitro study was to investigate the role of Mitochondrial fusion in the enzymatic site of Diet‐Induced fragments, as well as perturbations in vitro and in vivo. Cells were synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (ESR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis, and electron microscopy (TEM), respectively.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we have demonstrated that the enzymatic site of Mitochondrial fusion in vitro and in vivo. The results of the present study showed that the role of ROS in Diet‐Induced fragments is a potential target for the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it is concluded that the protective effect of reactive oxygen species is a promising candidate for the development of new therapeutic approaches. The mechanism of this work will be needed to clarify the mechanisms of the action of perturbations in the future.

## Human Abstract:
Background Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with metabolic heart disease (MHD). However, the mechanism by which ROS cause MHD is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial ROS are a key mediator of MHD. Methods and Results Mice fed a high‐fat high‐sucrose (HFHS) diet develop MHD with cardiac diastolic and mitochondrial dysfunction that is associated with oxidative posttranslational modifications of cardiac mitochondrial proteins. Transgenic mice that express catalase in mitochondria and wild‐type mice were fed an HFHS or control diet for 4 months. Cardiac mitochondria from HFHS ‐fed wild‐type mice had a 3‐fold greater rate of H 2 O 2 production (P =0.001 versus control diet fed), a 30% decrease in complex II substrate–driven oxygen consumption (P =0.006), 21% to 23% decreases in complex I and II substrate–driven ATP synthesis (P =0.01), and a 62% decrease in complex II activity (P =0.002
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Catalase targeted to the mitochondria ameliorated both mitochondrial dysfunction and the cardiac phenotype (LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction) caused by HFHS feeding. These structural and functional effects were associated with protection of complexes I and II from OPTMs, including reversible OPTMs of complex II that mediate complex II dysfunction in vitro. In this regard, we identified 2 cysteines in SDHB (Cys100 and Cys103) that regulate complex II function in a redox‐dependent manner. These findings suggest that efforts to decrease mitochondrial ROS or their effects on target proteins may be of value in the therapy of MHD

We investigated whether plasma FA composition was related to Stroke severity and functional outcome in acute Ischemic Stroke patients. Methods We prospectively enrolled 156 patients with first-episode cerebral infarction, within 7 days of symptom onset. The proportion of FAs was analyzed using gas chromatography, and the summation of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-PUFA), 18:3 ω3 α-linolenic acid, 20:3 ω3 eicosatrienoic acid, 20:5 ω3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 22:6 ω3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reported as Σω3-PUFAs.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results demonstrate that ω3-PUFA levels correlate with stroke severity at admission and functional outcomes at 3 months. ω3-PUFAs may be considered potential blood biomarkers for prognosis of acute non-cardiogenic Ischemic Stroke patients

## System Abstract:
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of myocardial infarction (MI) in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (AMI). Material/Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral anticoagulation (PCI) or intravenous (IV) or Myocardial Infarction (EF). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who received a combination of Deferred or adenovirus (2. 5 μg/kg) or placebo (n = 10). After 48 hours of admission, she was started on days 1, 2, 3, and 12 months.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the results of this study showed that the efficacy of MI in patients with STEMI who received Deferred or adenovirus (IV) or EF or placebo. The combination of myocardial infarction in AMI was significantly lower than those without the proportion of PCI. However, it may be useful for the treatment of acute ST. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Efficacy and safety of myocardial infarction in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objectives The aim of this study was to assess whether deferred stenting might reduce no-reflow and salvage myocardium in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation Myocardial infarction (STEMI). Background No-reflow is associated with adverse outcomes in STEMI. Methods This was a prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled, proof-of-concept trial in reperfused STEMI patients with ≥1 risk factors for no-reflow. Randomization was to deferred stenting with an intention-to-stent 4 to 16 h later or conventional treatment with immediate stenting. The primary outcome was the incidence of no-/slow-reflow (Thrombolysis In Myocardial infarction ≤2).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
For the first time, we conducted a proof-of-concept trial and found that deferred stenting in primary PCI reduced no-reflow and increased myocardial salvage compared with conventional primary PCI with immediate stenting. Two patients had recurrent myocardial infarction, which represents important balancing information on potential risks. The strategy is simple, pragmatic, and potentially widely applicable. Our results support the rationale for a substantive multicenter clinical trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of early deferred completion of PCI after reperfusion versus conventional treatment in STEMI patients at risk of no-reflow

## Human Abstract:
Background Epinephrine remains the drug of choice for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The aim of the present study is to assess whether the combination of vasopressin and Epinephrine, given their different mechanisms of action, provides better results than Epinephrine alone in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 22 Landrace/Large-White piglets, which were left untreated for 8 minutes before attempted resuscitation with precordial compression, mechanical ventilation and electrical defibrillation. Animals were randomized into 2 groups during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 11 animals who received saline as placebo (20 ml dilution, bolus) + Epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Epi group); and 11 animals who received vasopressin (0.4 IU/kg/20 ml dilution, bolus) + Epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Vaso-Epi group
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our study has demonstrated that the combination of epinephrine and Vasopressin in the treatment of VF cardiac arrest improved perfusion pressures and short-term survival, in comparison to the single use of epinephrine. This study adds some evidence to the existing literature of the epinephrine-Vasopressin combination benefits and further evaluation of these results should be undertaken in the future

## System Abstract:
Background Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n-3 PUFAs) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CAD). The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate the effect of dietary supplements on polyunsaturated fatty acids (ST) in patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods Serum levels of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery (PCI) were measured in the morning, and the association of fatty acids in coronary artery disease (AMI) and myocardial infarction (STEMI) were evaluated. Results Compared with 95% confidence intervals (CI) showed a significant increase in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and homocysteine contents (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that dietary supplements in patients with or without DM and homocysteine levels are associated with a higher risk of ST in AMI. These results suggest that fatty acids may be useful for the treatment of CAD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background A beneficial effect of a high n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake has been observed in heart failure patients, who are frequently insulin resistant. We investigated the potential influence of impaired glucose metabolism on the relation between dietary intake of n-3 LCPUFAs and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods This prospective cohort study was based on the Western Norway B-Vitamin Intervention Trial and included 2,378 patients with coronary artery disease with available baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and dietary data. Patients were sub-grouped as having no diabetes (HbA1c < 5.7 %), pre-diabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7 %), or diabetes (previous diabetes, fasting baseline serum glucose ≥7.0, or non-fasting glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this cohort of patients with established CAD, a high intake of n-3 LCPUFAs was associated with reduced risk of AMI, independent of HbA1c, in patients with diabetes. In patients without diabetes, a high intake was associated with increased risk of fatal AMI and lower HbA1c. These findings should motivate further studies on potential beneficial or adverse effects of a high n-3 LCPUFA intake in sub-groups of patients with CAD

The effect of nephropathy on diabetic function in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Abstract Background: At present, there are a lot of research about the effect of alprostadil on preventing contrast-induced nephropathy for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in diabetic patients, but the clinical efficacy is not consistent, so we conduct this study and therefore determine the dominant strategy for the treatment of PCI in diabetic patients based on the best evidence currently. Methods: An electronic database search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane library, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang to retrieve randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing alprostadil versus hydration on preventing CIN for PCI in diabetic patients.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our research shows that alprostadil has preventive effects on CIN, which can effectively reduce the incidence of CIN in coronary heart disease patients complicated with diabetes. For patients with diabetes undergoing PCI, the use of alprostadil before operation can reduce the incidence of CIN. Due to the limitations of the quality and quantity of the articles, this conclusion still needs further research to confirm. In the future, it still needs to explore appropriate scheme of alprostadil, including the dosage, usage, and use time. It also needs more and more large-scale design rigorous RCT and long-term follow-up, to obtain a wealth of clinical data and draw a more credible conclusion, so as to guide clinical

## System Abstract:
Highlights • We report the case of a 33-year-old male who presented with a chief complaint of dysphagia. He was admitted to our hospital for the first time. He had a history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, weight loss, and generalized lymphadenopathy. He was diagnosed with a diagnosis of Cocaine. He was treated with a Cocaine-Induced Renal Infarction of the left anterior descending artery. Histopathological examination revealed a large number of the lesion in the literature.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we report a rare case of a chief complaint of a 33-year-old male who presented with a history of upper anterior quadrant. Clinicians should be aware of the rarity of a patient with NF-1, especially if they should be considered as a cause of suspicion for the diagnosis of the disease.

A case report of cocaine for the treatment of Cocaine: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Cocaine abuse has been known to have detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. Its toxicity has been associated with myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents and mesenteric ischemia. The pathophysiology of Cocaine-related renal injury is multifactorial and involves renal hemodynamic changes, alterations in glomerular matrix synthesis, degradation and oxidative stress, and possibly induction of renal atherogenesis. Renal infarction as a result of Cocaine exposure, however, is rarely reported in the literature. Case presentation A 48 year-old male presented with a four-day history of severe right flank pain following Cocaine use. On presentation, he was tachycardic, febrile and had severe right costovertebral angle tenderness.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
cocaine intoxication is associated with multiple cases of vascular injury. Renal infarction as a result of cocaine use, however, is uncommon. In a patient with a history of cocaine abuse presenting with fevers and flank pain suggestive of urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis, cocaine-induced Renal infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis. The vasoconstrictive and thrombotic effects of cocaine are most likely the dominant factors in cocaine-induced Renal infarction. The possible atherogenic effect of cocaine and the relationship of this effect to renal infarct is likely to be a long term, rather than an acute factor.

He was treated with intravenous episodes of thrombosis, followed by hemodialysis. He had a dramatic improvement in the course of her disease (CKD). After a median sternotomy, she developed severe anemia and hypotension.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we report a rare case of a patient with heparin with a history of sudden onset and portal hypertension. This is the first description of the possibility of a diagnosis of CKD in the course of patients presenting with a high index of suspicion. This is the importance of the management of such cases, especially in the absence of the disease.

A case report and safety of heparin in patients with bivalirudin: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Here we present our attempt at off pump HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation using the anticoagulant bivalirudin in a patient with heparin induced thrombocytopenia, which resulted in thrombosis within the LVAD device. This required that our procedure be converted to on pump, and a new HeartMate II LVAD device to be implanted. In our view, this thrombotic event may have been caused by a number of factors that include bivalirudin ’ s (1) short half-life of about 20 minutes, (2) decreased activity with blood stasis, (3) inability to prevent clot propagation, and (4) uncertainty with real-time monitoring of therapeutic
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This is our attempted case with off pump LVAD placement reported with bivalirudin, which resulted in significant LVAD thrombosis. In this case, we were able to titrate bivalirudin to increase the ACT to the suggested goal of 300 seconds [ 5 - 8 ]. However, we still had a significant clot burden within the unattached LVAD. bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor that has a relatively short half-life of 25 minutes and can be used as an alternative to heparin in patients that have HIT. bivalirudin has shown procedural success in two open-label, multicenter studies looking at open and off pump CABG [ 8 ].

## System Abstract:
Background Emerging evidence suggests that Eicosapentaenoic acid (HF) is an essential step in the development of insulin resistance and lipid metabolism. However, little is known about the role of insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Methods Twenty male albino rats (56 mg/kg body weight), and 30 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic controls (n = 13) were analyzed. The results showed that fine liver disease (NAFLD), the latter was found to be associated with increased hepatic glucose tolerance test (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our data suggest that HF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in mice.

## Human Abstract:
Background Over the past two decades, a striking increase in the number of people with metabolic syndrome (MS) has taken place worldwide. With the elevated risk of not only diabetes but also cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, there is urgent need for strategies to prevent this emerging global epidemic. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched phospholipid (EPA-PL) on metabolic disorders. Methods Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 7) were fed one of the following 4 diets for a period of 4 weeks: 1) a modified AIN-96G diet with 5% corn oil (control diet); 2) a high fat (20% , wt/wt) and high fructose (20% , wt/wt) diet (HF diet); 3) the HF diet containing 1% SOY-PL (SOY-PL diet); 4) the HF diet containing 1% EPA-PL (EPA-PL diet
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results show that, compared with SOY-PL, EPA-PL exhibited superior effects on improving glucose and lipid metabolism. EPA-PL supplementation was efficacious in suppressing body fat accumulation, and alleviating insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis by modulating the secretion of adipocytokines and inflammatory cytokines, suppression of SREBP-1c mediated lipogenesis and enhancement of fatty acid β-oxidation. These findings suggest that EPA-PL could be used in the development of functional foods for the prevention of chronic metabolic diseases in humans

## System Abstract:
Background myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (STZ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Telmisartan on microvascular dysfunction and its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: We assessed the effects of GB on the viability of the liver and the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, as well as the underlying mechanism of action. Results We found that the inhibition of a potent inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase was prevented by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and heme oxygenase-1 (MCP-1).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that Telmisartan of the liver and diabetic rats. The results of the present study demonstrated that the inhibition of microvascular dysfunction and MCP-1 and the activation of the NADPH signaling pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

## Human Abstract:
Background We investigated the potential of Telmisartan to improve microvascular dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) pathway. Methods Forty-eight male rabbits were randomly allocated into sham-operated, I/R, GW9662, Telmisartan, Telmisartan–GW9662, or candesartan groups. Rabbits were anesthetized, and the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 60 minutes. Following reperfusion for 6 hours, angiotensin II content of the heart was determined using radioimmunoassay. Myocardial neutrophil accumulation and microvessel cross-sectional area were examined histologically. Myocardial capillaries were examined with transmission electron microscopy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Taken together, our study suggests that Telmisartan has protective effects against microvascular dysfunction during myocardial I/R, in part through PPARG-mediated effects

Effects of CKD on the treatment of Atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study.


## Human Abstract:
Background atherosclerosis is considered the major cause of the dramatic increase in cardiovascular mortality among patients suffering from Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the close connection between atherosclerosis and kidney dysfunction is undeniable, factors enhancing CKD-mediated plaque formation are still not well recognized. Results To increase our knowledge of this process we carried out a comparative proteomic analysis of blood plasma proteins isolated from 75 patients in various stages of renal dysfunction (CKD group), 25 patients with advanced cardiovascular disease (CVD group) and 25 healthy volunteers (HV group). The collected samples were subjected to 2D electrophoresis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In general, we have found that the same four proteins differentially accumulate in blood plasma of CKD and CVD patients. Accumulation of these proteins is not affected by treatment with statin or IACE. In case of two proteins: Fb and Hp, the character of the observed changes was similar in both analyzed groups (CKD5 and CVD). However, the remaining two proteins α-1-m and apoA-IV were expressed to significantly different levels. Thus, our results provide an additional line of evidence that different molecular mechanisms are involved in the development of CKD- and CVD-related atherosclerosis.

Downregulation of metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer cells by downregulating autophagy.


## Human Abstract:
Background The mechanisms involved in lung cancer (LC) progression are poorly understood making discovery of successful therapies difficult. Adaptor proteins play a crucial role in cancer as they link cell surface receptors to specific intracellular pathways. intersectin-1s (ITSN-1s) is an important multidomain adaptor protein implicated in the pathophysiology of numerous pulmonary diseases. To date, the role of ITSN-1s in LC has not been studied. Methods Human LC cells, human LC tissue and A549 LC cells stable transfected with myc-ITSN-1s construct (A549 + ITSN-1s) were used in correlation with biochemical, molecular biology and morphological studies.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We demonstrate that restoring ITSN-1s protein level impairs both proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, and restores cytoskeleton changes in favor of decreased cell migration and metastasis. Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism of LC regulation triggered by ITSN-1s deficiency, consistent with the idea that low ITSN-1s decreases Eps8-Cbl interaction and enhances the assembly of Eps8-mSos1 complex, leading to upregulation of Eps8 and activation of Rac1. ITSN-1s ’ ability to reverse the malignant features demonstrates the capability of this protein to regulate multiple pathways simultaneously which makes it an attractive therapeutic target. Further validation of ITSN-1s protein level in a large cohort of patients at different stages of LC could establish ITSN-1s as a predictor of prognosis and indicator of response to

## Human Abstract:
Background Although oxidative stress by accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in diabetes has become evident, it remains unclear what genes, involved in redox balance, would determine susceptibility for development of atherosclerosis in diabetes. This study evaluated the effect of genetic polymorphism of enzymes producing or responsible for reducing ROS on coronary artery calcification in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods An index for coronary-arteriosclerosis, coronary artery calcium score (CACS) was evaluated in 91 T2D patients using a multi-slice computed tomography. Patients were genotyped for ROS-scavenging enzymes, Glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), Catalase, Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, as well as SNPs of NADPH oxidase as ROS-promoting elements, genes related to onset of T2D (CAPN10, ADRB3, PPAR gamma, FATP4
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study revealed a genetic association between the presence of the Pro197Leu variant of the GPx-1 gene with MSCT-detected coronary artery calcification.

## Human Abstract:
Background Both insulin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are effective in the treatment of hyperglycaemia and amelioration of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes but have side effects including weight gain and fluid retention. The use of TZDs has been further hampered by the risk of adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure. The present study evaluated the effect of pioglitazone or insulin glargine on cardiac function and size as well as on surrogate markers of fluid retention such as weight, haemoglobin and natriuretic peptides. Methods Thirty patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and sulfonylurea were randomised to receive add-on therapy with insulin glargine or pioglitazone for 26 weeks.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
When choosing pioglitazone as an add-on treatment in patients with insufficiently controlled T2D, an increase in LVD vol by 11% and LA vol by 17% could be observed. This was parallel with an increase in natriuretic peptids. These changes in cardiac volume and natriuretic peptid-levels were not observed with insulin glargine. Larger randomised trials are warranted to confirm these findings. There is a need for tools to help clinicians to identify subsets of patients for whom this kind of therapy is likely to have particularly favourable/unfavourable effect, using readily identifiable clinical and laboratory factors.

## Human Abstract:
Background. Long-term outcomes (mortality and health-related quality of life) of sepsis have risen as important indicators for health care. Pulmonary infection and abdominal infection are the leading causes of sepsis. However, few researches about long-term outcomes focused on the origin of sepsis. Here we aim to study the clinical differences between pulmonary-sepsis and abdominal-sepsis and to investigate whether different infection foci were associated with long-term outcomes. Methods. Patients who survived after hospital discharge were followed up by telephone interview. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ5D) questionnaire.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Patients diagnosed with Sepsis show ongoing mortality after the Sepsis episode, with only 63.9% surviving one year after ICU discharge. Pulmonary-Sepsis had worse short-term and long-term outcomes, including ICU/hospital mortality, one-year mortality, and one-year quality of life. Pulmonary infection is a risk factor for one-year mortality and is associated with decreased health-related quality of life

## Human Abstract:
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme stored in azurophilic granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages and released into extracellular fluid in the setting of inflammatory process. The observation that myeloperoxidase is involved in oxidative stress and inflammation has been a leading factor to study myeloperoxidase as a possible marker of plaque instability and a useful clinical tool in the evaluation of patients with coronary heart disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the pathophysiological, analytical, and clinical characteristics of MPO and to summarize the state of art about the possible clinical use of MPO as a marker for diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
MPO is a marker of inflammation and oxidative stress that has been consistently demonstrated to be elevated in patients with ACS. However, the data so far available are relatively few; therefore, more studies are requested to precisely define the role of MPO. In particular all studies involving MPO assessment have used different methods, thus a standardization effort is needed. Furthermore, increased MPO is not likely to be specific for cardiac diseases, as activation of neutrophils and macrophages can occur in any infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative process, therefore, more studies should address and clarify these points.

## Human Abstract:
Background New animal models of chronic pulmonary hypertension in mice are needed. The injection of Monocrotaline is an established model of pulmonary hypertension in rats. The aim of this study was to establish a murine model of pulmonary hypertension by injection of the active metabolite, Monocrotaline pyrrole. Methods Survival studies, computed tomographic scanning, histology, bronchoalveolar lavage were performed, and arterial blood gases and hemodynamics were measured in animals which received an intravenous injection of different doses of Monocrotaline pyrrole. Results Monocrotaline pyrrole induced pulmonary hypertension in Sprague Dawley rats. When injected into mice, Monocrotaline pyrrole induced dose-dependant mortality in C57Bl6/N and BALB/c mice (dose range 6–15 mg/kg bodyweight).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
To conclude, this study reports pathological pulmonary changes induced by an application of the putative electrophile MCTP in mice. Administration of MCTP in mice and rats results in acute lung injury. In rats, but not in mice, it ultimately leads to severe and progressive pulmonary hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report and characterize an animal model of acute lung injury induced by monocrotaline pyrrole in mice. Thus, MCTP injection in mice may be a valuable animal model to investigate both the efficacy of new therapies for acute respiratory failure and fibrotic repair mechanisms

The Relationship between Pain and pain relief in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Orofacial pain can arise from different regions and etiologies. Some of the most debilitating pain conditions arise from the structures innervated by the trigeminal system (head, face, masticatory musculature, temporomandibular joint and associated structures). The problem with referred pain is the misdiagnosis and unnecessary therapy directed to the pain location instead of its origin. When craniofacial pain is the sole sign of myocardial ischemia, failure to recognize its cardiac source can endanger the patient. In particular, apart from unnecessary dental treatments, patients with acute myocardial infarction who do not experience chest pain run a very high risk of misdiagnosis and death.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This review focused on the mechanisms of referral craniofacial pain with cardiac origin outlined the guidelines for in time diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction) with non-odontogenic craniofacial pain as one of the signs or the only announcement. Scientific knowledge should be addressed to all medical personnel involved in dental treatment.

## Human Abstract:
Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is commonly accompanied by pain that is discordant with the degree of peripheRAl pathology. Very little is known about the cerebRAl processes involved in pain processing in RA. Here we investigated resting-state bRAin connectivity associated with prolonged pain in RA. Methods: 24 RA subjects and 19 matched controls were compared with regard to both behavioRAl measures of pain perception and resting-resting state fMRI data acquired subsequently to fMRI sessions involving pain stimuli. The resting-state fMRI bRAin connectivity was investigated using 159 seed regions located in cardinal pain processing bRAin regions.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In the current study we have examined how RA patients differ from HC with regard to resting state functional connectivity. The geneRAl pattern that emerged was a stronger connectivity of regions in the medial pain system and regions in sensory- and motor cortex in RA. Additionally, RA related hypo- connectivity was found between frontal control areas and premotor regions that are associated with processing of noxious stimuli. However, the functional role of the group differences in connectivity remains to be established since the associations to subjective pain data and clinical severity scores were absent

OBJECTIVE To determine whether modestly severe obesity modifies Glucose homeostasis, levels of cardiometabolic markers, and HDL function in African Americans (AAs) and white Americans (WAs) with Prediabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 145 subjects with Prediabetes (N = 61 WAs, N = 84 AAs, mean age 46.5 ± 11.2 years, mean BMI 37.8 ± 6.3 kg/m 2). We measured fasting levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and an inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein [ CRP ]); HDL functionality (i.e., levels of paraoxonase 1 [ PON1 ]); and levels of oxidized LDL, adiponectin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
African Americans experience type 2 diabetes and the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality disproportionately more than white Americans (16, 17). However, the exact contributions of obesity to type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease in African Americans remain debatable. Thus, whether severe obesity differentially modifies the metabolic mediators and precursors of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and CVD in African Americans and white Americans remains to be investigated. Given the increasing epidemic of obesity and its potential impact on Glucose regulation, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes among US ethnic and racial populations, we felt it was imperative to perform a comprehensive assessment of clinical and metabolic characteristics of modestly severely obese African Americans and white Americans with

Glucagon-like peptide-1 and the exenatide analogue AC3174 improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in rats with chronic heart failure
## Entities:
AC3174; Glucagon-like peptide-1; glucagon-like peptide-1; chronic heart failure; peptide; cardiac remodeling
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of Glucagon-like peptide-1 on cardiac function in rats with chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods: The rat model of chronic kidney disease (NAFLD) was induced by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 30), and the animals were subjected to a single dose of 7. 5 mg/kg body weight (BW), or vehicle (50 mg/kg/day). The experiment was administered to the CCl 4 and 6 weeks after surgery.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Glucagon-like peptide-1 on cardiac function in rats with CHF. However, the protective effects of PTZ-induced on inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes.

## Human Abstract:
Background Accumulating evidence suggests glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) exerts cardioprotective effects in animal models of myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that chronic treatment with GLP-1 or the exenatide analog AC3174 would improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, insulin sensitivity, and exercise capacity (EC) in rats with MI-induced chronic heart failure (CHF) caused by coronary artery ligation. Methods Two weeks post-MI, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with GLP-1 (2.5 or 25 pmol/kg/min), AC3174 (1.7 or 5 pmol/kg/min) or vehicle via subcutaneous infusion for 11 weeks. Cardiac function and morphology were assessed by echocardiography during treatment.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
GLP-1 and the exenatide analog, AC3174, each independently demonstrated cardioprotective effects after long-term treatment in rats with MI-induced CHF, a model of moderate, stable, compensated heart failure. Overall, the cardioprotective benefits of GLP-1 and AC3174 appeared similar, suggesting that in this model, the major GLP-1 metabolite (GLP-1 9-36) is not necessary for mediating these specific improvements. Therefore, based on the findings from the present study and the accumulating body of clinical evidence with exenatide, therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists may represent a promising approach for the treatment of patients with CHF or cardiovascular disease associated with type 2 diabetes, supporting the need for further research in

Mannose binding lectin and macrophage migration inhibitory factor Gene Polymorphisms in Turkish Children with cardiomyopathy: No Association with MBL2 Codon 54 A/B Genotype, but an Association between MIF -173 CC Genotype
## Entities:
MIF; cardiomyopathy; MBL; Mannose binding lectin; macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MBL2
## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between Mannose binding lectin and macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene polymorphisms in Turkish children with cardiomyopathy. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with suspected admitted to a single dose of MIF (n = 165), and a group of whom (2) was administered twice daily for 6 months. Patients were stratified according to the inclusion criteria. Follow-up examinations were performed to determine the frequency and mortality rate of the disease. Results: The median age was higher than that of the controls (P < 0. 001) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study showed that Mannose binding lectin and macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene polymorphisms in Turkish children with cardiomyopathy to a single dose of MIF. The results of the present meta-analysis suggested that the association between the controls and mortality rate were associated with a lower risk of the frequency of the disease.

The role of MBL in the treatment of Mannose binding lectin: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Myocardial inflammation is one of the commonest mechanisms in cardiomyopathy (CMP). Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule in innate immunity, while macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a constitutive element of the host defenses. We investigated the possible association between polymorphisms of MBL2 and MIF genes and CMP in Turkish children. Twenty-children with CMP and 30 healthy controls were analyzed for codon 54 A/B polymorphism in MBL, and -173 G/C polymorphism in MIF genes by using PCR-RFLP methods. No significant difference was found between genotypes and alleles of MBL2 gene codon 54 A/B polymorphism in patients and controls (p 0.05).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study is the first to investigate the MBL and MIF gene polymorphisms in Turkish children with CMP. We conclude that CC genotype of MIF (-173) gene may be a risk factor for CMP patients. However, further studies with larger samples are needed to address the exact role of this polymorphism in CMP

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of MiR-30b on Coronary artery (CGRP) -induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Material/Methods We examined the expression of Homocysteine (Hcy) in human coronary Artery (CHB) cells and immortalized bovine endothelium (VSMCs). In addition, we assessed the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (TLR) on vascular endothelial cell proliferation and protein levels in a rat model of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we investigated whether the role of p38 MAPK in the presence of caspase 3 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that MiR-30b could suppress vascular endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that TLR is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
## System New Title:
The role of homocysteine in a rat model of lung cancer cells.


## Human Abstract:
homocysteine (Hcy) is an independent risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, etc. There is a close relationship between the vascular endothelial cell apoptosis and these diseases. Recent studies have shown homocysteine can induce apoptosis in endothelial cells, which may be an important mechanism for the development of theses cardiovascular diseases. Although there are several reports about how the Hcy induces apoptosis in endothelial cells, the exact mechanism is not fully understood. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA. Previous studies have shown that there is a close relationship between several microRNAs and cell apoptosis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We found that Hcy can induce apoptosis in HCAECs in a dose-dependent manner. In this process, the expression of caspase-3 was upregulated and miR-30b was downregulated. In addition, overexpression of miR-30b inhibited apoptosis Hcy-induced in HCAECs by downregulating the caspase-3 expression. Therefore, miR-30b may play an important role in apoptosis induced by Hcy in endothelial cells

## System Abstract:
Background Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to determine the association between serum angiopoietin-like protein 2 (IMT) and carotid intima-media thickness (intima-media thickness) in diabetic subjects. Methods Pulse blood glucose levels were measured using B-mode x-ray absorptiometry (WC), and the relationship between the presence of DR, hypertension, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined the associations between the plasma concentration of autoantibodies and the occurrence of atherosclerosis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that serum angiopoietin-like protein 2 levels are associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
## System New Title:
Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Although recent animal studies have suggested that angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), a novel inflammatory adipokine, is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, in rodents, little is known regarding whether serum ANGPTL2 level is also associated with atherosclerosis in humans, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum ANGPTL2 concentration is associated with atherosclerosis by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in subjects with type 2 diabetes without previous history of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we examined the clinical and biochemical variables associated with serum ANGPLT2 concentration.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we found that the serum ANGPTL2 concentration is significantly and positively associated with carotid IMT in human subjects with type 2 diabetes. This further supports the recently proposed notion that ANGPTL2 may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in humans [ 9, 10, 14 ], similarly to its possible role in the regulation of vascular function in rodents [ 9, 10, 12 - 14 ]. Further prospective studies are needed to determine whether ANGPTL2 is a useful predictive marker for CVD

## System Abstract:
Background Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor blocker, but its role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarct remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of GLP-1 (OM) in a mouse model of a Glucose-dependent manner. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of oral glucose tolerance in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Results We found a significant decrease in fasting blood pressure (ROS) production and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (p < 0. 05).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrated that OM of GLP-1 in a mouse model of ischemic stroke in a Glucose-dependent manner of the treatment of myocardial infarct. The combination of oral administration was effective in reducing the pathogenesis of ROS production. These results suggest that the inhibition of glucose metabolism may be beneficial in the management of the disease.

## Human Abstract:
Background The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors Sitagliptin and Vildagliptin lower blood Glucose by augmenting endogenous levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin which also confers cardioprotection. As such, we hypothesized that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors are also cardioprotective. Methods In ex vivo experiments: Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomized to receive by oral gavage either Vildagliptin (20 mg/kg/day), Sitagliptin (100 mg/kg/day), or water for 2 weeks. Excised hearts were Langendorff-perfused with buffer containing either 5 mmol/L or 11 mmol/L Glucose and subjected to 35 minutes ischaemia/120 minutes reperfusion.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our present study confirms that DPP-4 inhibitors elicit cardioprotection against acute IRI similar to that seen for GLP-1, moreover these effects appear to be Glucose-sensitive

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of MicroRNA-320 on Left ventricular (I/R) injury in the rat model. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group (n = 10), myocardial ischemia (MI), heart failure (ischemic stroke). The hearts were administered orally with a single dose of 0. 1 μg/kg/min in the left anterior descending coronary artery task, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Learning was induced by intraperitoneal injection.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results demonstrate that MicroRNA-320 could protect against I/R injury in the rat model.

## Human Abstract:
The primary objective of this study investigated the role of microRNA-320 (miR-320) on left ventricular remodeling in the rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and we intended to explore the myocardial mechanism of miR-320-mediated myocardium protection. We collected 120 male Wistar rats (240–280 g) in this study and then randomly divided them into three groups: (1) sham surgery group (sham group: n = 40); (2) ischemia-reperfusion model group (I/R group: n = 40); and (3) I/R model with antagomir-320 group (I/R + antagomir-320 group: n = 40).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
To summarize, our study results support the view that the expression of miR-320 might be up-regulated in the rat model of myocardial I/R injury, and miR-320 might contribute to the prevention of left Ventricular Remodeling after myocardial I/R injury. Consequently, decreased miR-320 expression may, in turn, be considered as a possible predictive factor in reducing the risk of left Ventricular Remodeling risk after myocardial I/R injury and improving cardiac function

## Human Abstract:
Background: candesartan cilexetil has been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk. Whether it is advantageous to combine candesartan cilexetil with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or uptitrate it in cases of insufficient blood pressure control has not been fully investigated under routine clinical conditions. Methods: CHILI Triple T is a prospective, noninterventional, observational study. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension and added cardiovascular risk received a fixed-dose combination of candesartan cilexetil 16 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg (combination therapy group) or high-dose monotherapy with candesartan cilexetil 32 mg (high-dose monotherapy group). Results: A total of 4600 patients with a mean age of 63.1 ± 11.0 years, of which 44.7% were female, was
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Both the fixed-dose combination of candesartan cilexetil 16 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg and high-dose monotherapy with candesartan 32 mg are highly effective and safe for lowering blood pressure in patients at increased cardiovascular risk with mild, moderate, or severe hypertension. The choice of either strategy therefore largely depends on the principal aim: blood pressure reduction with pronounced volume restriction or pronounced additional end-organ protection

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between angiotensin-2 type 1 (HMGB1) and angiotensinogen (AGT) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Genome-wide genome-wide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and logistic regression analyses. The subjects were divided into two groups: control group (n = 89) and coronary heart disease (CVD). The primary endpoint was the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that HMGB1 and AGT and CHD in patients with T2DM was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. These findings suggest that the association between these results in the pathogenesis of subjects with diabetes. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of the disease in the future.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Increased activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be important in promoting coronary heart disease (CHD) and renal dysfunction, but limited data are available on associations between angiotensin type 1 receptor (AGT1R) and angiotensinogen (AGT) genotypes in type 2 diabetes. Methods Study participants were diabetics from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cardiovascular pathophysiology (including AGT1R T573C, AGT1R A1166C, and AGT M235T) and presence of renal dysfunction (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) or history of CHD.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, among type 2 diabetics, the AGT1R 1166 C-allele is directly associated with kidney dysfunction in men and women but with CHD only in men. The AGT 235 T-allele is associated with CHD in women. Previous evidence suggests that these polymorphisms are associated with up-regulation of the RAS, and therefore, these data further support the central role of RAS activation in CKD and CHD

## System Abstract:
Background: Ethanol is a chronic inflammatory process that is characterized by excessive formation of NMDA receptors, which contributes to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR4) on the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway in human alcohol dehydrogenase (PG) cells. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (i) control group (n = 10), and ii (i).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TLR4 could suppress the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway in PG cells. These findings suggest that the inhibition of the expression of Ethanol may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.

## Human Abstract:
Objective In the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis, local macrophage-driven inflammation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in particular, are recognized as key factors. Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease mortality. Here we examined in cultured human macrophages whether Ethanol modulates the intracellular processes involved in the secretion of IL-1β. Results Ethanol decreased dose-dependently the production of mature IL-1β induced by activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome, i.e. ATP, cholesterol crystals, serum amyloid A and nigericin. Ethanol had no significant effect on the expression of NLRP3 or IL1B mRNA in LPS-primed macrophages.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Ethanol inhibits the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in cultured human macrophages by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. The inhibition of the inflammasomes by alcohol may contribute to the propensity for infections associated with excessive use of alcohol, and to the atheroprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption.

## System Abstract:
Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum emphysema (forced expiratory volume) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (FEV 1) and chronic cor pulmonale (IP). Methods Sixty-three patients were recruited from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 22), and Group B (control group). The subjects were included in this cross-sectional analysis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that serum emphysema is an independent risk factor for COPD in patients with IP. Therefore, it is important to investigate the relationship between forced and obstructive pulmonary disease.
## System New Title:
Association between emphysema and COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand signal transduction receptor that can initiate and perpetuate inflammation. Its soluble isoform (sRAGE) acts as a decoy receptor for RAGE ligands, and is thought to afford protection against inflammation. With the present study, we aimed at determining whether circulating sRAGE is correlated with emphysema and chronic cor pulmonale in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods In 200 COPD patients and 201 age- and sex-matched controls, we measured lung function by spirometry, and sRAGE by ELISA method. We also measured the plasma levels of two RAGE ligands, N-epsilon-carboxymethyl lysine and S100A12, by ELISA method.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we found that circulating sRAGE is significantly reduced in COPD patients with respect to age- and sex-matched controls. emphysema and chronic cor pulmonale are independent predictors of reduced sRAGE levels in COPD

Association between cancer and risk factors in patients with advanced gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objectives To investigate whether there is an association between use of angiotensin receptor blockers and risk of cancer. Design Cohort study of risk of cancer in people treated with angiotensin receptor blockers compared with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Effects were explored with time updated covariates in Cox models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diabetes and metformin/insulin use, hypertension, heart failure, statin use, socioeconomic status, alcohol, smoking, and calendar year. Absolute changes in risk were predicted from a Poisson model incorporating the strongest determinants of risk from the main analysis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In a cohort of individuals treated for hypertension, we found no evidence of an overall increased risk of cancer among those exposed to angiotensin receptor blockers and a protective association for lung cancer specifically. There was some evidence that the risk of breast and prostate cancers could be raised, though we cannot rule out non-causal mechanisms. In absolute terms, observed risk increases were relatively small and must be weighed against the likely benefits of treatment. Further research might focus on exploring the apparent protective association with lung cancer, and clarifying whether patients at high risk of breast or prostate cancer would benefit from alternative, equally effective antihypertensive drugs; we recommend that future studies include a careful assessment of the likely causality of any

Diastolic dysfunction in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes mellitus with normal systolic function
## Entities:
diabetes; Diastolic dysfunction; diabetes mellitus; diastolic dysfunction; type 2 diabetes mellitus
## System Abstract:
Background diastolic dysfunction (T2DM) is characterized by abnormal low-density lipoprotein (LV) dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and diabetic retinopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Diastolic dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic function. Methods Serum glucose tolerance tests (LVDD) was performed using two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. Left ventricular ejection fraction (HbA1c) was defined as FPG in the left ventricle, and the remaining healthy subjects were classified according to the severity of the legs.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The prevalence of Diastolic dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic function was found to be an independent risk factor for the treatment of T2DM. The results of the present study showed that LVDD is an important determinant of HbA1c in the pathogenesis of LV dysfunction. However, it may be a useful tool for the management of the disease. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between diabetes and risk factors in patients with type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background: The incidence of heart failure in diabetic subjects is high even in the absence of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Aims: The purpose of this study was to study the incidence of Diastolic dysfunction in diabetic subjects and its relation to age, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, obesity indices and diabetic microangiopathies. Settings and Design: This was a case control prospective study conducted at the teaching hospital during a one year period. Materials and Methods: A total of 127 subjects (case) with type 2 diabetes of more than five years duration were studied.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Overall prevalence of diastolic dysfunction was 54.33% in asymptomatic type 2 DM subjects in the present study. Asymptomatic type 2 DM had significantly high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction as compared to healthy subjects. LV diastolic abnormalities were correlated with the duration of diabetes and with diabetic microangiopathies, like retinopathy and autonomic neuropathy. In the present study, DM was the strongest independent factor for LV diastolic dysfunction. This study confirms that asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is more prevalent in subjects with type 2-DM. There was a significant correlation of LV diastolic dysfunction with the duration of diabetes, glycatedHbA1c levels, obesity indices (WC and WHR), retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy and hypertriglyceridemia, as determined by multivariate

The role of cancer stem cells to genotoxic therapy in non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
A vast variety of nonstructural proteins have been studied for their key roles and involvement in a number of biological phenomenona. Interleukin-32 is a novel cytokine whose presence has been confirmed in most of the mammals except rodents. The IL-32 gene was identified on human chromosome 16 p13.3. The gene has eight exons and nine splice variants, namely, IL-32 α, IL-32 β, IL-32 γ, IL-32 δ, IL-32 ε, IL-32 ζ, IL-32 η, IL-32 θ, and IL-32s. It was found to induce the expression of various inflammatory cytokines including TNF- α, IL-6, and IL-1 β as well as macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and has been reported previously to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of a number of inflammatory disorders, namely, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Gastric Inflammation and cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The role of cytokines towards inflammation and modulation of various infectious diseases is a hot topic today. In conclusion, IL-32 is a key modulator in the pathogenesis of various clinical problems which is mostly induced by IL-8 and enhances the severity of Gastric Inflammation, gastric cancer, and chronic rhino Sinusitis. It not only contributes in the development of inflammation but also induces the expression of a cascade of some potent inflammatory cytokines. There is a need for further investigations of the different pathways regulated by IL-32 which will in turn allow the identification of potential targets for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune, infectious, and inflammatory diseases

Methods: A total of 104 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 14). The subjects were divided into two groups: control group (CG), and those without DPN. Their fasting blood pressure (BP), and insulin sensitivity were measured by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results The mean age of 12 months was significantly higher than those in the presence of the lower SES (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, the present study showed that N-terminal composition was associated with the severity of i and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that i is an independent risk factor for the prevention of T2DM.

## Human Abstract:
Background The hormone somatostatin inhibits growth hormone release from the pituitary gland and is theoretically linked to diabetes and diabetes related complications. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between levels of the stable somatostatin precursor, N-terminal prosomatostatin (NT-proSST), with mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. Methods In 1,326 T2DM outpatients, participating in this ZODIAC prospective cohort study, Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the independent relationship between plasma NT-proSST concentrations with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Results Median concentration of NT-proSST was 592 [ IQR 450–783 ] pmol/L.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
After correction for a set of well-known risk factors, high plasma NT-proSST concentrations were not independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with T2DM. The plasma NT-proSST concentration does not appear to be suitable as a biomarker for the prediction of mortality in stable outpatient with T2DM

## System Abstract:
Background The goal of this study was to investigate the role of particle glucose tolerance in respirable rats and to explore the underlying mechanism in the development of lung injury. Methods The expression of the wild type 2 (10 mg/kg) was administered to the rat model of quartz-induced (SC), and to evaluate the effect of the surface on the cellular response to the changes in the regulation of the liver. The remaining animals were divided into four groups: (i) control group (n = 6) and normal saline (PBS).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the present study demonstrated that the expression of particle glucose tolerance in respirable rats and in the development of lung injury in the liver. The results of our findings indicate that the surface area of the wild type 2 (10 mg/kg) and the underlying mechanism are involved in the pathogenesis of SC.

## Human Abstract:
Persistent inflammation and associated excessive oxidative stress have been cruciALly implicated in quartz-induced pulmonary diseases, including fibrosis and cancer. We have investigated the significance of the particle surface reactivity of respirable quartz dust in relation to the in vivo generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and the associated induction of oxidative stress responses in the lung. Therefore, rats were intratracheALly instilled with 2 mg quartz (DQ12) or quartz whose surface was modified by either polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide (PVNO) or ALuminium lactate (AL). Seven days after instillation, the bronchoALveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was anALysed for markers of inflammation (totAL/differentiAL cell counts), levels of pulmonary oxidants (H 2 O 2, nitrite), antioxidant status (trolox equivALent antioxidant capacity), as well as for markers of lung tissue damage,
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study showed that coating of the reactive particle surface inhibited quartz-induced production of ROS and RNS in the respiratory tract, a process that was closely associated with a reduced level of inflammatory cells. Obviously, since these endpoints were obtained at the persistent stage of inflammation (i.e. seven days following instillation) one should be cautious to extrapolate our results to the acute inflammatory response by quartz. Pulmonary ROS and RNS release is considered as a cruciAL and unifying factor in the quartz-induced adverse heALth effects, including fibrogenicity and carcinogenicity. Despite the fact that non-coated quartz caused a significant ROS/RNS generation and lung tissue damage (i.e.

## Human Abstract:
Background Inflammation is a common feature in the majority of cardiovascular disease, including Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Levels of pro-inflammatory markers have been found in increasing levels in serum from diabetic patients (DP). Moreover, levels of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are increased in coronary arteries from DP. Methods Through a cross-sectional design, patients who underwent CABG were recruited. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were cultured and COX-2 was measured by western blot. Biochemical and clinical data were collected from the medical record and by blood testing. COX-2 expression was analyzed in internal mammary artery cross-sections by confocal microscopy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, this work describes for the first time that vascular inflammation in diabetic patients is determined by changes in the lipid profile, rather than by glycaemia. This might have important clinical implications in the way that diabetic patients need to be treated to prevent cardiosvacular complications originated by the inflammatory process

The Relationship between periodontitis and diabetes in patients with type 2 Diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Biomarkers are highly specific and sensitive indicators of disease activity. Resistin is a recently discovered adipocytokine, having a potent biomarker quality. Initially Resistin was thought to be produced by adipocytes alone; however, emerging evidence suggests that it is also produced in abundance by various cells of the immunoinflammatory system, indicating its role in various chronic inflammatory diseases. Data suggests that Resistin plays a role in obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, and periodontitis. Resistin derived its name from the original observation that it induced insulin resistance (resist-in: resist insulin) in mice and is downregulated in mature murine adipocytes cultured in the presence of insulin sensitizing drugs like
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
At present there are several biomarkers, studied in relation to Periodontitis and diabetes. However, there are very few studies in the field of periodontics addressing the relation between chronic Periodontitis and Resistin, which acts as a biomarker “ the connecting link between Periodontitis, obesity, and diabetes. ” The currently available literature suggests that the levels of Resistin are increased in the patients with chronic Periodontitis compared to the clinically healthy controls. Resistin induces insulin resistance, and large amount of Resistin is secreted by adipocytes. Increased Resistin levels in Periodontitis may thus be considered to pose a risk for diabetes by decreasing the insulin sensitivity.

## System Abstract:
Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of Left atrial fibrillation (ESUS) and its relationship with the severity of Stroke. Material/Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all consecutive Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke admitted to the Department of Neurology Hospital between January 2006 and December 2013. All the participants were divided into three groups: control group (n = 27) and the left arm.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our study showed that Left atrial fibrillation in AF patients with acute ischemic stroke and the severity of Stroke and its risk factors. The predictive value of ESUS was not associated with worse prognosis. Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke should be considered as a prognostic factor for the treatment of diabetes. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a well-established risk factor for Stroke. Interestingly, Ischemic Stroke increases risk of incident AF in patients without prior diagnosed AF. For better risk stratification for post-Stroke AF, we studied left atrial (LA) size and mechanical function using two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking imaging in patients with acute Ischemic Stroke. Methods A total of 227 patients (132 males, age 67 ± 12) with acute Ischemic Stroke without a history of AF underwent 2D transthoracic echocardiography and speckle tracking imaging for the assessment of LA volume index and global LA longitudinal strain (LALS).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The global LALS assessed by 2D speckle tracking imaging provides incremental information for predicting post Stroke AF over clinical variables, Stroke severity, and LA volume index. The global LALS may reflect structural and functional susceptibility for AF, and provide new strategies to better risk stratification for post Stroke AF in patients with acute ischemic Stroke.

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, HDL cholesterol and Smoking on the lipid profile of Arterial Stiffness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 140 subjects with type 1 diabetes were enrolled in the study. All participants were divided into three groups: control group (n = 32), and healthy controls (mean age duration). All patients were randomized to receive either a single dose of 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. RESULTS During the beginning of the disease, we compared the associations between baseline and postprandial glycemia and increased risk of cardiovascular events (p < 0. 01) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we have demonstrated that cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, HDL cholesterol, and Smoking were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 1 diabetes. The results of the present meta-analysis showed that the lipid profile of 500 and postprandial glycemia in the beginning of the disease is not effective in the treatment of Arterial Stiffness. However, it is expected to be useful for the prevention of 12 weeks in subjects with T2DM. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy and pulse waveform analysis (PWA) measures of arterial stiffness in a childhood-onset type 1 diabetes population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Cardiac autonomic nerve function was measured in the baseline examination of the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of diabetes Complications Study of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes by heart rate variability (R-R interval) during deep breathing and expressed as expiration-to-inspiration (E/I) ratio. Other cardiovascular and diabetes factors were also assessed. PWA was performed using SphgymoCor Px on 144 participants at the 18-year follow-up examination. Univariate and multivariate analyses for associations between baseline nerve function and other cardiovascular and diabetes-related factors were performed for augmentation index (AIx), augmentation pressure (AP), and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR), a surrogate marker of myocardial
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The key finding in this study is that baseline Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (measured by E/I ratio) strongly correlates with both arterial stiffness (measured by both augmentation index and augmentation pressure) and reduced estimated myocardial perfusion (measured by SEVR) in childhood-onset type 1 diabetes some 18 years later. Along with Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, known cardiovascular risk factors such as reduced HDL cholesterol and cigarette smoking were also predictive of the increased stiffness indexes AIx and AP. Poorer glycemic control (higher baseline HbA 1) in this population was also associated with higher AP and with lower SEVR.

The role of fibrosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
In Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, SSc), persistent activation of myofibroblast leads to severe skin and organ fibrosis resistant to therapy. Increased mechanical stiffness in the involved fibrotic tissues is a hallmark clinical feature and a cause of disabling symptoms. Myocardin Related Transcription Factor-A (MRTF-A) is a transcriptional co-activator that is sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus under mechanical stress or growth factor stimulation. Our objective was to determine if MRTF-A is activated in the disease microenvironment to produce more extracellular matrix in progressive SSc. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrate that nuclear translocation of MRTF-A in Scleroderma tissues occurs in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and dermal fibroblasts, consistent with enhanced signaling in multiple cell lineages exposed to the stiff extracellular
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Skin and organ based fibrosis in SSc remains a challenging condition to treat because once established, fibrosis is mantained by a feedforward loop of increased adhesion, contractility, and increased mechanical stress leading to further myofibroblast differentiation and matrix modification. MRTF-A is recognized as a major mechanosensitive signaling molecule that, following mechanical force, is released from cytoplasmic G-actin and translocates to the nucleus to activate gene transcription of multiple genes in a cell specific manner [ 15, 17 ]. Outside of the context of SSc, a number of published studies support the notion that MRTF-A signaling has an essential role in fibrosis in different disease settings including LPA induced peritoneal fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis; as well as bowel; hepatic and renal fibrosis [ 84 – 89

Objective To evaluate intraoperative subtenon triamcinolone acetonide (TA) as an adjunct to Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation. Design Retrospective comparative case series. Participants Forty-two consecutive cases of uncontrolled glaucoma undergoing AGV implantation: 19 eyes receiving intraoperative subtenon TA and 23 eyes that did not receive TA. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on consecutive pseudophakic adult patients with uncontrolled glaucoma undergoing AGV with and without intraoperative subtenon TA injection by a single surgeon. Clinical data were collected from 42 eyes and analyzed for the first 6 months after surgery. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of glaucoma medications prior to and after AGV
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we do not advocate the use of intraoperative subtenon TA as an adjunctive measure to prevent the HP phase, especially for inferior AGV implantation. Given the comparable mean IOP between TA and non-TA cases at 6 months, and the development of endophthalmitis in a TA case, other measures to address the HP should be employed. Short-term measures such as bleb needling and the introduction of glaucoma medicines seem to represent a safer approach to address the HP

Differential Associations of Oral glucose Tolerance Test–Derived Measures of Insulin Sensitivity and Pancreatic β-Cell Function With coronary artery calcification and Microalbuminuria in Type 2 diabetes
## Entities:
diabetes; coronary artery calcification; glucose; insulin sensitivity; insulin; Insulin
## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE Insulin resistance (IR) has been associated with insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of fasting glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in lean subjects (n = 45) and sixteen adults (mean age 15. 3 ± 7. 7 years). The associations between HbA 1c (FPG) and Microalbuminuria (HOMA-IR) were measured in a 24-week fashion to determine the relative risk of coronary artery calcification (CAC). RESULTS At the beginning of the baseline (ADA) curve (AUC) adjusted for C-peptide analysis showed a significant increase in body mass index (BMI) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we have shown that IR was associated with insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in T2DM patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE We evaluated relationships of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) –derived measures of Insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β-cell function with indices of diabetes complications in a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes who are free of overt cardiovascular or renal disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A subset of participants from the Penn diabetes Heart Study (n = 672; mean age 59 ± 8 years; 67% male; 60% Caucasian) underwent a standard 2-h, 75-g OGTT. Insulin sensitivity was estimated using the Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI), and β-cell function was estimated using the Insulinogenic Index.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In our study of patients with type 2 diabetes, we report that the Insulinogenic Index, but not the Matsuda ISI, associated with microalbuminuria after controlling for established cardiovascular risk factors but was not independent of diabetes duration and BMI. Conversely, the Matsuda ISI, but not the Insulinogenic Index, associated with CAC after controlling for multiple cardiovascular risk factors. However, this association was not independent of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, relative to fasting-derived HOMA measures, these OGTT-derived dynamic indices of β-cell function and Insulin sensitivity seemed to have stronger associations with disease complications.

hyperhomocysteinemia is independently associated with albuminuria in the population-based CoLaus study
## Entities:

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and albuminuria (CKD) and coronary angiography (PI) in the elderly population. Methods We examined the association between microalbuminuria and vascular endothelial function in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 67). The subjects were selected with eGFR and sex matched controls. The associations between plasma renin activity and homocysteine levels were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that microalbuminuria and CKD may be associated with elevated plasma renin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between homocysteine and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Increased serum levels of homocysteine and uric acid have each been associated with cardiovascular risk. We analyzed whether homocysteine and uric acid were associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria independently of each other. We also investigated the association of MTHFR polymorphisms related to homocysteine with albuminuria to get further insight into causality. Methods This was a cross-sectional population-based study in Caucasians (n = 5913). hyperhomocysteinemia was defined as total serum homocysteine ≥ 15 μmol/L. albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 mg/g. Results Uric acid was associated positively with homocysteine (r = 0.246 in men and r = 0.287 in women, P < 0.001
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with higher prevalence of albuminuria in men and in women, independently of renal function. The association of hyperhomocysteinemia with albuminuria was not only independent of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, but also as strong as the one found for these two conditions, which are major causes of albuminuria. Individuals carrying MTHFR genotypes associated with higher tHcy concentrations were at increased risk for albuminuria. This latter finding supports the hypothesis that homocysteine causes renal damage. Further studies are needed to explore whether lowering serum homocysteine levels might prevent kidney damage.

Heart rhythm turbulence and NT-proBNP in decompensated Liver cirrhosis – a pilot study
## Entities:

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of liver cirrhosis and NT-proBNP in patients with decompensated Liver cirrhosis (STEMI). Methods A total of 34 Yorkshire pigs were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 45), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Blood pressure (BP) scans were used to assess the relationship between the heart rate and severity of the disease duration. Results We found a significant increase in serum creatinine (HR) levels and increased risk of bleeding variability (P < 0. 0001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results indicate that the increase in serum creatinine levels in patients with STEMI and NT-proBNP was associated with increased risk of bleeding variability. The findings of the present study showed that liver cirrhosis of the heart rate and severity of the disease is an independent prognostic factor for the treatment of decompensated Liver cirrhosis. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of HR in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

NT-proBNP and risk factors for the treatment of BNP in patients with Liver cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Summary Background Heart rhythm turbulence (HRT) is a novel tool for evaluation of cardiovascular mortality. Liver cirrhosis is associated with hemodynamic and myocardial disturbances termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. In the stable stage of Liver cirrhosis, systolic and myocardial dysfunction is correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The aim was to evaluate HRT and its correlation with NT-proBNP, echocardiographic and biochemical parameters in patients with decompensation of Liver cirrhosis. Material/Methods The study included 18 patients with decompensated Liver cirrhosis and 18 healthy volunteers. Participants underwent echocardiography and 24-hour ECG monitoring. Serum NT-proBNP and other biochemical parameters were measured.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
To conclude, our study demonstrates that patients with decompensation of cirrhosis have elevated levels of NT-proBNP and left ventricle diastolic dysfunction. In a majority of study participants, TO and TS, or at least 1 of these parameters, stayed within normal limits. However, TO values in cirrhotic patients differed significantly from the control group. Increased NT-proBNP level is a result of myocardium lesion typical for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (mainly diastolic dysfunction) and not a result of biochemical changes and hyperkinetic circulation. Elevated NT-proBNP level can indicate risk of symptomatic heart failure development.

The effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis
## Entities:
kidney disease; homocysteine; people with kidney disease; folic acid; Folic acid
## System Abstract:
Background The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effect of folic acid (FA) on cardiovascular mortality. Methods PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published until July 2013. MEDLINE, people with kidney disease, and Cochrane Library were used to assess the association between the groups ’ s quality of life (QoL) and adverse effects. Results A total of 113 patients were included in the study. The results showed that the difference in the overall response rate (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) yielded a significant increase in the odds ratio (p < 0. 001).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our meta-analysis showed that FA is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in the odds of QoL. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between homocysteine and risk factors in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Objective To systematically review the effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular outcomes in people with kidney disease. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov to June 2011. Study selection Randomised trials in people with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease or end stage kidney disease or with a functioning kidney transplant reporting at least 100 patient years of follow-up and assessing the effect of folic acid based homocysteine lowering therapy. No language restrictions were applied. Data extraction Two reviewers independently extracted data on study setting, design, and outcomes using a standardised form.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, folic acid based homocysteine lowering does not prevent cardiovascular events in people with kidney disease and consideration should be given to discontinuing its use for cardiovascular prevention in this population. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events homocysteine lowering in the general population has failed to show clear cardiovascular benefits unlike the situation with people with homocysteinuria who have noticeably increased homocysteine levels homocysteine levels increase as estimated glomerular filtration rate levels decline In over 10 000 people with a range of severity of kidney disease no benefit was seen from folic acid based homocysteine lowering therapy for cardiovascular events, all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, requirement for dialysis treatment, or access thrombosis The results were consistent across categories of kidney disease (end stage kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, and functioning kidney transplant), with no evidence of heterogeneity Our findings suggest that folic acid based homocysteine lowering should not be used for cardiovascular prevention in people

## System Abstract:
Background fibrosis is an auto-immune disease characterized by chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TUDCA in the pathogenesis of bleomycin (BLM) -induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Methods: Wild-type (WT) and wild type II collagen (n = 14) were intratracheally instilled from wild-type (Mice). The hearts were sacrificed in lung tissue, and histopathology was carried out by the TUNEL staining. Results. The results showed that the expression of COX-2 in the substantia nigra (P < 0. 05) was significantly higher in the presence of the actin (α-SMA) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), a marker of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that TUDCA plays a key role in the pathogenesis of BLM in mice.

## Human Abstract:
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic devastating disease with poor prognosis. Multiple pathological processes, including inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, and oxidative stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Recent findings suggested that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is constitutively activated in IPF and acts as a central regulator in the pathogenesis of IPF. The aim of our study was to reveal the value of Andrographolide on bleomycin-induced inflammation and fibrosis in mice. The indicated dosages of Andrographolide were administered in mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our data demonstrate that Andrographolide reduced the severity of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis probably through inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. These data suggest Andrographolide may be considered as an effective and safe drug for the potential treatment of IPF. Nevertheless, animal studies are limited to hours while IPF patients often are treated for several months or years. Taken together, we believe that andrograophlide may exert its beneficial effects over time when it is given at the early stage of IPF

## System Abstract:
Background Stroke is a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the use of a biracial polymorphism in a large cohort of young women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in a prospective registry of Young patients with a history of a middle body mass index (BMI). The participants were divided into two groups: control group (n = 67), and the controls (7) were included. The incidences of cerebral infarction was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The odds ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to confirm the effect of.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the use of a biracial polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of cerebral infarction than in a large cohort of young women with a history of CVD.

Stroke and risk factors in patients with ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The genes encoding proteins in the thrombomodulin-protein C pathway are promising candidate genes for Stroke susceptibility because of their importance in thrombosis regulation and inflammatory response. Several published studies have shown that the Ala455Val thrombomodulin polymorphism is associated with ischemic heart disease, but none has examined the association with Stroke. Using data from the Stroke Prevention in Young Women Study, we sought to determine the association between the Ala455Val thrombomodulin polymorphism and the occurrence of ischemic Stroke in young women. Methods All 59 hospitals in the greater Baltimore-Washington area participated in a population-based case-control study of Stroke in young women.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Thrombomodulin has not previously been examined as a candidate gene for Stroke susceptibility. We found that among women aged 15 to 44 years, the AA genotype is more prevalent among blacks than whites and is associated with increased risk of early-onset ischemic Stroke. Removing Strokes potentially related to cardioembolic phenomena increased this association. Further studies are needed to determine whether this association is due to population stratification, linkage to a nearby functional polymorphism, or variation in Thrombomodulin expression or function

## System Abstract:
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Metformin and sitagliptin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar Rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 32), Inflammation, and renal dysfunction. They were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), followed by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle (40 mg/kg), intraperitoneally (i. P .), i. V, and Apoptosis (1 mg/kg/day).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our results suggest that Metformin and sitagliptin and anti-inflammatory effects are associated with cardiotoxicity in rats. However, it may be useful for the treatment of LPS. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

The protective role of Metformin in rats with Diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
DOXorubicin (DOX) is a widely used antineoplastic drug whose efficacy is limited by its Cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of the antidiabetic drugs Metformin (250 mg/kg dissolved in DW p.o. for seven days) and sitagliptin (10 mg/kg dissolved in DW p.o. for seven days) in a model of DOX-induced (single dose 15 mg/kg i.p. at the fifth day) Cardiotoxicity in rats. Results of our study revealed that pretreatment with Metformin or sitagliptin produced significant (P < 0.05) cardiac protection manifested by a significant decrease in serum levels of LDH and CK-MB enzymes and cardiac MDA and total nitrites and nitrates levels, a significant increase in cardiac SOD activity, and remarkable improvement in the histopathological features as well as a significant reduction in the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2, iNOS, and caspase-3 enzymes as compared to DOX
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the present findings reveal that pretreatment with either Metformin or sitagliptin has significantly attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats due to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. Metformin and/or sitagliptin may be suggested to be preferable drug (s) for diabetic patients suffering from cancer and receiving DOXorubicin as a component of their chemotherapy regimen. Further studies to elucidate more of their mechanisms and potentials are advised

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between DR and diabetes-related complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of 224 diabetic subjects (mean age 57 years), who had normoalbuminuria, who had moderate nonproliferative (PAD), and a nationally representative sample of nondiabetic individuals (n = 98), aged duration of 6 months (CD) or obese (DM). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that DR and diabetes-related complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, PAD was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, it is important to confirm the role of the primary outcome in diabetic subjects with T2DM.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE The prognostic significance of Diabetic retinopathy (DR) for death and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is debated. We investigated the association of DR with all-cause mortality and CV events in patients with diabetes by a systematic review and meta-analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The electronic databases Medline and Embase were searched for cohort studies that evaluated DR in type 2 or type 1 diabetic patients and reported total mortality and/or fatal and nonfatal CV events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft, ischemic changes on a conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram, transient ischemic attack, nonfatal stroke, or lower leg amputation.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
These meta-analyses of cohort studies showed that the presence of any degree of DR or advanced DR was associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality and CV events (fatal and nonfatal) in both type 2 and type 1 diabetic patients. Data from the current study show that funduscopy can be a practical tool to identify patients who are at increased risk for adverse outcomes, as demonstrated by the influence of DR in the post-test probability of having an event. Our literature search was extensive; we tested for and found no evidence of publication bias.

## System Abstract:
Background Neuron specific enolase (TH) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with resuscitation. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of Mild therapeutic hypothermia on the outcome of hypothermia in an unselected population. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a total of 244 participants (n = 123), who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the intensive care unit (ICU) between October 2009 and September 2015. The primary endpoint was the first time, and the relationship between the two groups were analyzed.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that Mild therapeutic hypothermia on hypothermia in patients with resuscitation in an unselected population. However, our results suggest that TH should be considered as a prognostic factor for the treatment of osteoporosis in the management of DM. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

The Role of Mild in Patients with hypothermia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Neuron specific enolase (NSE) has been proven effective in predicting neurological outcome after cardiac arrest with a current cut off recommendation of 33 μg/l. However, most of the corresponding studies were conducted before the introduction of mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH). Therefore we conducted a study investigating the association between NSE and neurological outcome in patients treated with MTH Methods In this prospective observational cohort study the data of patients after cardiac arrest receiving MTH (n = 97) were consecutively collected and compared with a retrospective non-hypothermia (NH) group (n = 133).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, in patients after cardiac arrest, single measurements of NSE should be interpreted with caution as many patient- and treatment-related factors may influence the amount and kinetics of NSE release. In accordance with our results, NSE levels drawn 72 hours after ROSC correlated poorly with neurological outcome according to current recommended cutoffs in patients treated with MTH. Therefore the usefulness of current NSE cutoff values for prognosis during post-resuscitation care seems limited in these patients. Decision on treatment continuation or discontinuation should therefore always be based on a full assessment of complimentary clinical observations and neurophysiological testing

Regulation of Inducible Nitric oxide Synthase (iNOS) and its Potential Role in Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Heart Failure
## Entities:
Diabetes; NOS; heart failure; Nitric oxide; Heart Failure
## System Abstract:
Background: Nitric oxide (NO) is a common type of Insulin resistance, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of iNOS in the regulation of Inducible endothelial growth factor (SNP), Diabetes, and Heart Failure. Material/Methods A total of 66 patients with T2DM were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, controlled trial. The results showed that the presence of a single nucleotide synthase (eNOS), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was found to be the most important targets for the treatment of hypertension and HF.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the regulation of iNOS is associated with the development of hypertension and Heart Failure in the treatment of T2DM. These results suggest that eNOS plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NO and HF in patients with RA.
## System New Title:
The role of heart failure in patients with NOS: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are the enzymes responsible for Nitric oxide (NO) generation. NO is a reactive oxygen species as well as a reactive nitrogen species. It is a free radical which mediates several biological effects. It is clear that the generation and actions of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are regulated and extend to almost every cell type and function within the circulation. In mammals 3 distinct isoforms of NOS have been identified: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). The important isoform in the regulation of insulin resistance (IR) is iNOS.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
It has been shown that iNOS has been implicated in many human diseases associated with inflammation [ 10, 11 ]. To identify individuals with NO deficiency and increased cardiovascular risk, new diagNOStic tools, apart from vasomotor testing to assess NO bioactivity, based on the recent advances in the understanding of NO metabolism have been developed. In parallel, new modes of NO delivery to patients have been studied, and new NO donating compounds have been developed to not only substitute for NO deficiency but also to release exogenously supplied NO at specific cellular targets and to overcome disadvantages of conventional NO donors such as organic nitrate and nitrite esters [ 174 ].

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification and a mediator of insulin resistance. This study evaluated the association of plasma fetuin-A and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 738 individuals with type 2 diabetes (mean age 58.7 years, 37.1% female) without known cardiovascular or kidney disease were included in this cross-sectional analysis. RESULTS Subjects with PAD had a significantly lower fetuin-A (264.3 vs. 293.4 ng/dl, P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, a 1-SD decrease in fetuin-A increased the odds of PAD (odds ratio 1.6, P = 0.02).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Low levels of fetuin-A have been linked to medial arterial calcification and flow limiting aortic stenosis in humans (8, 9). In this study, we demonstrate that lower levels of fetuin-A are associated with PAD in subjects with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report such a relationship in the absence of advanced kidney disease or prevalent CVD. Notably, in analysis stratified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Heart Association–defined hsCRP risk strata (10), fetuin-A conferred increased odds of PAD in subjects with hsCRP < 3 mg/dl and also in participants with interleukin (IL) -6 levels below the median (data not shown

## System Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between overweight and obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 137 patients with type 1 Diabetes were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Patients were divided into three groups: control group (n = 112) and women (mean age, BMI ≥30 kg/m 2). Body mass index was defined as a predictor of glucose tolerance test (MMSE) and waist circumference (95% confidence interval [ CI ]). RESULTS During the end period, the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (DM) was significantly higher in increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the prevalence of overweight and obesity were significantly higher in patients with type 1 Diabetes. These findings suggest that DM is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE To investigate the potential relationship between overweight, obesity, and severe obesity and the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in patients with type 1 Diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied patients with type 1 Diabetes included in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry during 1998–2003, and they were followed up until hospitalization for HF, death, or 31 December 2009. Cox regression was used to estimate relative risks. RESULTS In a sample of 20,985 type 1 diabetic patients (mean age, 38.6 years; mean BMI, 25.0 kg/m 2), 635 patients were hospitalized with HF as a primary or secondary diagnosis during a median follow-up of 9.1
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this study of 20,985 type 1 diabetic patients followed-up over 9 years, we found Obesity (defined as BMI 30 kg/m 2) to be associated with a markedly increased risk of hospitalization for HF. However, overweight, defined as BMI 25–30 kg/m 2, was not associated with any increased risk of hospitalization for HF. The incidence of HF was high, especially in patients with Obesity and severe Obesity (≥35 kg/m 2), demonstrating that BMI has a large clinical impact on the need for hospitalization for HF in this population.

Background The lectin-like domain of TNF-α can be mimicked by synthetic TIP peptides and represents an innovative pharmacologic option to treat edematous respiratory failure. TIP inhalation was shown to reduce pulmonary edema and improve gas exchange. In addition to its edema resolution effect, TIP peptides may exert some anti-inflammatory properties. The present study therefore investigates the influence of the inhaled TIP peptide AP318 on intrapulmonary inflammatory response in a porcine model of systemic sepsis. Methods In a randomized-blinded setting lung injury was induced in 18 pigs by lipopolysaccharide-infusion and a second hit with a short period of ventilator-induced lung stress, followed by a six-hour observation period.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In a porcine model of systemic inflammatory response related lung injury with short-term VILI a repetitive inhalation of AP318 significantly attenuated the intrapulmonary expression of inflammatory marker genes. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of the TNF-α ’ s lectin-like domain beyond mere edema reduction and suggest for the first time an in vivo anti-inflammatory effect in endotoxemic lung injury

The effects of heart failure on the risk of cancer cachexia in patients with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
cancer cachexia is defined as a multifactorial syndrome of involuntary weight loss characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass and progressive functional impairment. It is postulated that cardiac dysfunction/atrophy parallels skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia. Cardiotoxic chemotherapy may additionally result in cardiac dysfunction and Heart failure in some cancer patients. Heart failure thus may be a consequence of either ongoing cachexia or chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity; at the same time, Heart failure can result in cachexia, especially muscle wasting. Therefore, the subsequent Heart failure and cardiac cachexia can exacerbate the existing cancer-induced cachexia. We discuss these bilateral effects between cancer cachexia and Heart failure in cancer patients.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
It is postulated that over time, during development of cancer cachexia, significant cardiac dysfunction and progressive cardiac muscle wasting may occur. Also, developed HF as a consequence of cachexia itself or pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or anticancer drug cardiotoxicity may play a role as a further source of cachexia. Possible bilateral effects between cancer-induced cachexia and subsequent HF require investigation in human studies. Although a large and growing body of literature has investigated the cardiotoxic effects of several types of chemotherapy agents, whether cachexia aggravates chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity requires investigation. Moving forward, identification of skeletal muscle loss in cancer patients with regular CT scan as well as parallel cardiac assessments with feasible tools (i.e., echocardiography) will contribute to development of novel knowledge in

Effect of Metformin on the protective effect of AMPK in rats with Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic side effects. Recent studies established that METformin (MET), an oral antidiabetic drug, possesses an antioxidant activity. However, whether it can protect against DOX-induced energy starvation and mitochondrial damage has not been reported. Our results, in a rat model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, show that DOX treatment significantly increased serum levels of LDH and CK-MB, indicators of cardiac injury, and induced expression of hypertrophic gene markers. DOX also caused marked decreases in the cardiac levels of glutathione, CoA-SH and ATP, and mRNA expression of catalase and NQO-1.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Results from the present investigation reveal that DOX induces its cardiotoxicity by decreasing cardiac level of CoA-SH and increasing that of acetyl-CoA, with the consequent inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and ATP generation. This is aggravated by the increased susceptibility of the heart to oxidant injury due to DOX-induced reduction of cardiac GSH level, as well as the decrease in CAT and NQO-1 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that MET prevents all of these biochemical and molecular changes and other histopathological and ultrastructural deteriorations in the cardiac tissues, warranting its coadministration with DOX to ameliorate its cardiotoxicity

Association between serum levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Intensive multifactorial treatment aimed at prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease may reduce left ventricular (LV) echocardiographic abnormalities in diabetic subjects. Plasma N-terminal (NT) -proBNP predicts CV mortality in diabetic patients but the association between P-NT-proBNP and the putative residual abnormalities in such patients are not well described. This study examined echocardiographic measurements of LV hypertrophy, atrial dilatation and LV dysfunction and their relation to P-NT-proBNP levels or subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria receiving intensive multifactorial treatment. Methods Echocardiography including tissue Doppler imaging and P-NT-proBNP measurements were performed in 200 patients without prior CAD.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Among asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria that received intensive multifactorial treatment, patients with increased P-NT-proBNP levels did not have more echocardiographic abnormalities. LV diastolic dysfunction was frequently observed, where as LV hypertrophy was less frequent and associated with significant CAD

## System Abstract:
Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of smoke in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CRPC). Methods: One hundred and thirty healthy controls were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) group B (n = 5), and severe (2) D ]. The primary end point was to verify the effect of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The prevalence of smoke in patients with CRPC was associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. These findings suggest that COPD may be a useful prognostic factor for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.

## Human Abstract:
Purpose Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) related to wood smoke exposure is characterized by important inflammation of the central and peripheral airways without significant emphysema. The objective of this study is to describe the Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) level in women with COPD related to wood smoke exposure and to compare it with the BHR in women with COPD related to tobacco smoking. Materials and methods Two groups of women with stable COPD were studied: (1) wood smoke exposed (WS-COPD); and (2) tobacco smoke exposed (TS-COPD). A methacholine challenge test (MCT) was performed in all patients according to American Thoracic Society criteria.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study found the occurrence of moderate to severe BHR in women with WS-COPD that was more severe than in TS-COPD women with similar age and airflow obstruction. We speculate that the structural and inflammatory changes induced by the chronic exposure to wood smoke, described in other studies, explains the BHR severity in WS-COPD patients and the differences when compared to TS-COPD patients. Future studies may clarify our understanding of the impact of BHR on COPD physiopathology, phenotypes, and treatment strategies

## Human Abstract:
sepsis is a common condition that is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and health-care cost. Pulmonary and non-pulmonary sepsis are common causes of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality from ARDS remains high despite protective lung ventilation, and currently there are no specific pharmacotherapies to treat sepsis or ARDS. sepsis and ARDS are characterised by activation of the inflammatory cascade. Although there is much focus on the study of the dysregulated inflammation and its suppression, the associated activation of the haemostatic system has been largely ignored until recently. There has been extensive interest in the role that platelet activation can have in the inflammatory response through induction, aggregation and activation of leucocytes and other
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Despite the advancements in knowledge of the pathophysiology in Sepsis and ARDS, there remains a significant human and economic impact on society as a whole, and there is no effective pharmacological treatment for ARDS. There has been and continues to be extensive work on the role platelets play in Sepsis and ARDS. It has been demonstrated through laboratory in vitro studies, animal studies, and observational analysis that Aspirin may be of benefit in the treatment of Sepsis and ARDS. The results of ongoing randomised controlled trials will help elucidate the role of Aspirin in treating Sepsis and ARDS

Organic nitrates and nitrate Resistance in diabetes: The Role of Vascular Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress with Emphasis on antioxidant Properties of pentaerithrityl tetranitrate
## Entities:
diabetes; antioxidant; role of vascular dysfunction; nitrate; pentaerithrityl tetranitrate; nitrates
## System Abstract:
Objective: To investigate the role of nitrates in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM) and nitrate (MCD) strains. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control group (n = 20), and the controls (N = 10). The sample comprised of the body fat, and the levels of antioxidant enzymes were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The study was carried out to determine the effect of the metabolic parameters on the lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, the present study demonstrated that nitrates plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DM and oxidative stress in rats. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of antioxidant enzymes in the treatment of diabetes.

The role of diabetes mellitus in the treatment of type 2 Diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Organic nitrates represent a class of drugs which are clinically used for treatment of ischemic symptoms of angina as well as for congestive heart failure based on the idea to overcome the impaired NO bioavailability by “ NO ” replacement therapy. The present paper is focused on parallels between diabetes mellitus and nitrate tolerance, and aims to discuss the mechanisms underlying nitrate resistance in the setting of diabetes. Since oxidative stress was identified as an important factor in the development of tolerance to organic nitrates, but also represents a hallmark of diabetic complications, this may represent a common principle for both disorders where therapeutic intervention should start.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The endothelium plays a pivotal role in modulating the reactivity of vascular smooth muscle through the formation of several vasoactive substances. There is good evidence for endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction in diabetes which is shared by the pharmacologically-induced phenomenon of nitrate tolerance. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the setting of both vascular complications and may explain the presence of nitrate resistance in diabetic vessels, a major drawback for the use of nitrates in diabetic patients. Since nitrate tolerance as well as diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction nicely respond to antioxidant treatment, this may be the key to improve the safety and efficacy of a given organic nitrate in diabetic patients.

## System Abstract:
Background The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of obesity on regadenoson-induced myocardial hyperemia in a rabbit model. Methods The Framingham signal intensity and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed to evaluate the relationship between the two groups. The primary outcome was based on the influence of the vasodilator lumen on the left arm. Results Under the same time, the mean difference was found to be a critical factor for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD).

## System New Title:
The role of obesity in the treatment of CAD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
The A2 A receptor agonist, regadenoson, is increasingly used as a vasodilator during nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging. regadenoson is administered as a single, fixed dose. Given the frequency of obesity in patients with symptoms of heart disease, it is important to know whether the fixed dose of regadenoson produces maximal coronary hyperemia in subjects of widely varying body size. Thirty subjects (12 female, 18 male, mean BMI 30.3 ± 6.5, range 19.6–46.6) were imaged on a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Imaging with a saturation recovery radial turboFLASH sequence was done first at rest, then during adenosine infusion (140 μg/kg/min) and 30 min later with regadenoson (0.4 mg/5 ml bolus
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
regadenoson is safe, well tolerated and time efficient as a pharmacological vasodilator for cardiac stress perfusion MRI studies. Only one intravenous access is required and there is no need for a specialized, magnet-safe infusion pump. Myocardial perfusion reserve measured during administration of fixed-dose, bolus administration of regadenoson is comparable to that obtained with adenosine across a range of patient sizes. Simplification of the stress protocol may make MR an increasingly attractive modality for the diagnostic assessment of subjects with known or suspected CAD. A multi-center trial to determine the performance of regadenoson as a stress agent in cardiac MRI seems warranted

## Human Abstract:
Breast tumor metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Breast tumor cells frequently metastasize to brain and initiate severe therapeutic complications. The chances of brain metastasis are further elevated in patients with HER2 overexpression. In the current study, we evaluated the anti-metastatic effects of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) in a novel murine model of breast tumor metastasis. The MDA-MB-231-BR (BR-brain seeking) breast tumor cells stably transfected with luciferase were injected into the left ventricle of mouse heart and the migration of cells to brain was monitored using a non-invasive IVIS bio-luminescent imaging system. In order to study the efficacy of PEITC in preventing the number of tumor cells migrating to brain, mice were given 10 µmol PEITC by oral gavage for ten days prior to intra-cardiac injection of tumor cells labeled with quantum
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We recently demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of PEITC in breast cancer cells and that the effect of PEITC was more pronounced in HER2 positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [ 32 ]. Our current study presents a novel role of PEITC in preventing and suppressing breast cancer Metastasis in vivo possibly by suppressing HER2, EGFR and VEGF, which are known to promote cell motility. Taken together, the results from our study indicate that PEITC suppresses brain Metastasis of breast cancer cells.

## Human Abstract:
Background Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been applied in treating tuberculosis (TB) based on the TCM syndromes with the effects of inhibiting Mycobacterium, strengthening the body immune system, and reducing the pulmonary toxicity. We used bioinformatic methods to study the clinical and pathological characteristics of pulmonary TB patients with TCM syndromes. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification - coupled two dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (iTRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS) methods were applied to screen differentially expressed serum proteins. Methods Pulmonary TB cases were divided into four distinctive TCM syndromes: pulmonary Yin deficiency (PYD) syndrome, hyperactivity of fire due to Yin deficiency (HFYD) syndrome, deficiency of Qi and Yin (DQY) syndrome, and deficiency of Yin and Yang (DYY )
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
To sum up, TCM syndromes classification in pulmonary TB cases were closely related to the clinical and pathological changes and ESR. After treatment, most cases were transformed into PYD syndrome. Serum proteins such as GGH, IGHG3 and HPT were specifically over-expressed in PYD, HFYD, and DQY patients, respectively. GGH was associated with folate metabolism in PYD patients, and IGHG3 was linked to the control of Mycobacterium infection in HFYD patients. However, HPT was involved in hypoxia in DQY patients. The results provide clinical evidence and experimental basis for TCM syndromes of pulmonary TB.

Background We analyzed specific effects of an add-on therapy with Pioglitazone compared to metformin and their combination in patients with basal Insulin treatment on biomarkers of CV risk. Methods In this double-blind, randomized, multicentre, active comparator controlled trial, 121 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Inclusions: treatment with basal Insulin, HbA 1C 6.5% - 8.5% , age 30 - 75 years. After glargine therapy over 2 weeks for titration towards FBG ≤ 7.8 mmol/L, patients received either (A) bid 850 mg metformin (n = 42), (B) bid 15 mg Pioglitazone (n = 40), or (C) 30 mg Pioglitazone plus 1.7 g metformin (n = 39) over 6
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In patients with long term type 2 diabetes and suboptimal stable Insulin treatment, the addition of pioglitazone but not metformin reduced the level of inflammatory biomarkers such as MMP-9 and hs-CRP and increased Insulin sensitivity and adiponectin. The combination of pioglitazone with metformin resulted in better HbA 1C and lipid control without added effect on inflammation, fibrinolysis, and renal function. No serious side effects were observed in any regimen but pioglitazone treatment was associated with more edema and weight gain as expected. Controlled clinical trials measuring cardiovascular endpoints are needed to compare risk benefit of individual add-on treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs to basal Insulin, a question which is of high clinical relevance

Association between homocysteine and endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer ’ s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are positively correlated with cardiovascular mortality in diabetes. However, the joint effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia (HG) on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. Mild (22 µmol/L) and moderate (88 µmol/L) HHcy were induced in cystathionine β-synthase wild-type (Cbs +/+) and heterozygous-deficient (Cbs −/+) mice by a high-methionine (HM) diet. HG was induced by consecutive injection of streptozotocin. We found that HG worsened HHcy and elevated Hcy levels to 53 and 173 µmol/L in Cbs +/+ and Cbs −/+ mice fed an HM diet, respectively.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
HG worsens HHcy. HHcy and HG induce ED, which is potentiated by a combination of HHcy and HG via μ-calpain/PKCβ 2 activation–induced eNOS-pThr497/495 and eNOS inactivation. µ-Calpain activation–caused ED may contribute to heightened cardiovascular risk seen in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients with HHcy. The current study offers a novel insight into the proatherogenic role of µ-calpain under the combination of HHcy and HG and proposes µ-calpain as a critical therapeutic target for HHcy-aggravated cardiovascular complications in diabetes.

Protective effects of extraosseous calcification on the treatment of intracerebral and Extraosseous Calcification in a rat model of cardiovascular calcification: a case report.


## Human Abstract:
Cardiovascular calcification is prevalent in the aging population and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus, giving rise to substantial morbidity and mortality. Vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla-protein (MGP) is an important inhibitor of calcification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of high-dose menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation (100 µg/g diet) on the development of Extraosseous Calcification in a murine model. Calcification was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy combined with high phosphate diet in rats. Sham operated animals served as controls. Animals received high or low MK-7 diets for 12 weeks.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our data provide evidence for a protective effect of high-dose MK-7 supplementation on cardiovascular calcification. MK-7 supplementation could not prevent CKD-associated hypertension and hypertrophy but prevented calcification of affected tissues. Since vitamin K has no reported side effects, it seems a promising therapeutic agent [ 59 ]. The effect of MK-7 is likely to act via vitamin K-dependent proteins such as MGP and it is tempting to speculate whether these results can be transferred to CKD patients

Depression and depressive symptoms during pregnancy were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from logistic regression models.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results, combined with those reported by others [ 6 ], suggest that the risk of preeclampsia is increased in women experiencing Depression during pregnancy. Available research suggests that Depression is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, and that fairly accurate and feasible screening measures are available [ 22 - 24 ]. Longitudinal cohort studies, with prospective clinical assessment of Depression, and studies in ethnically and racially diverse populations are warranted

A case report of everolimus for the treatment of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. It is characterized by the development of multiple, benign tumors in several organs throughout the body. Lesions occur in the brain, kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, and skin and result in seizures and epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and renal and pulmonary organ system dysfunction, as well as other complications. Elucidation of the molecular pathways and etiological factors responsible for causing TSC has led to a paradigm shift in the management and treatment of the disease.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
everolimus is approved for the treatment of adults with renal angiomyolipoma and TSC not requiring immediate surgery, and of adults and children ≥3 years of age with SEGA associated with TSC who require therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical resection. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of everolimus have been demonstrated in multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. These studies continue in their extension phases with the goal of establishing the long-term safety and efficacy profile of everolimus in patients with TSC. everolimus, an orally administered mTOR inhibitor, is the first pharmacological therapy approved for the treatment of TSC.

## Human Abstract:
Background: Tissue Iron deposition may disturb functions of the organs. In many diseases like thalassemia, the patients suffer from Iron deposition in kidney and heart tissues. Deferoxamine (DF) is a synthetic Iron chelator and Silymarin (SM) is an antioxidant and also a candidate for Iron chelating. This study was designed to investigate the effect of DF and SM combination against kidney and heart Iron deposition in an Iron overload rat model. Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups. The Iron overloading was performed by Iron dextran 100 mg/kg/day every other day during 2 weeks and in the 3 rd week, Iron dextran was discontinued and the animals were treated daily with combination of SM (200 mg/kg/day,
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Co-administration of SM and DF did not attenuate the serum level of Iron reservoir such as ferritin and combination of these agents was not protective against Iron deposition in kidney and heart. However, according to the current study and the work done by others, [ 13 14 15 24 25 26 27 ] it seems that SM or DF alone demonstrated a better result to protect organ against Iron disorder

The role of adiponectin in the treatment of COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease which may be complicated by development of co-morbidities including metabolic disorders. Metabolic disorders commonly associated with this disease contribute to lung function impairment and mortality. Systemic inflammation appears to be a major factor linking COPD to metabolic alterations. Adipose tissue seems to interfere with systemic inflammation in COPD patients by producing a large number of proteins, known as “ adipokines ”, involved in various processes such as metabolism, immunity and inflammation. There is evidence that adiponectin is an important modulator of inflammatory processes implicated in airway pathophysiology.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this review, the role of Adiponectin system in lung disorders has been analyzed. Investigations on Adiponectin systemic production and epithelial cell receptors at lung level have provided new insight in COPD pathophysiology. Serum levels of Adiponectin represent a significant diagnostic and prognostic marker for COPD disease. The molecular mechanisms through which Adiponectin mediates its effects in the lungs are not clearly defined; however, AdipoRs expression on lung epithelial cells of COPD patients strengthens the hypothesis of its role in pathophysiological conditions of the lungs. Altogether, the reported evidence indicate that Adiponectin and its oligomerization state are involved in lung diseases and that its increased levels are mainly due to HMW

Association of acute kidney injury in patients with Mannitol: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI), which is a major complication after cardiovascular surgery, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Diuretic agents are frequently used to improve urine output and to facilitate fluid management in these patients. mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is used in the perioperative setting in the belief that it exerts reno-protective properties. In a recent study on uncomplicated postcardiac-surgery patients with normal renal function, mannitol increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), possibly by a deswelling effect on tubular cells. Furthermore, experimental studies have previously shown that renal ischemia causes an endothelial cell injury and dysfunction followed by endothelial cell edema.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In the present study of patients with postoperative AKI caused by severe heart failure, requiring inotropic and mechanical support, we showed that treatment with the osmotic diuretic, mannitol, induces a renal vasodilation and increases RBF with maintained filtration fraction and renal oxygenation

## System Abstract:
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between short-term ventricular systolic Systolic Dysfunction (LV) function in patients with hypertensive Heart Failure. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between January 2007 and December 2014. The primary endpoint was the first diagnosis of Hypertensive and heart failure (HF). Results: The mean age of 31 years was compared between the two groups. The patient had a 10-year history of hypertension, right atrial fibrillation (n = 49) and the left atrium.

The prognostic value of function in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Right ventricular (RV) Systolic Dysfunction is now recognized widely as a strong and independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Reduction of RV systolic function more closely predicts impaired exercise tolerance and poor survival than does left ventricular (LV) systolic function. In spite of this, there is a dearth of data on RV function in hypertensive HF which is the commonest form of HF in sub-Saharan Africa. We therefore conducted a prospective cohort study of hypertensive HF patients presenting to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Abuja, Nigeria over an 8 year period.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
hypertensive heart failure is a major cause of RV systolic dysfunction in Nigeria, which was present in over 40% of such patients. Importantly, this occurred despite a low prevalence of clinical ischemic heart disease in our cohort. In addition, RV systolic dysfunction is also associated with poorer prognosis in hypertensive HF. Detailed RV assessment should therefore be part of the echocardiography assessment of hypertensive HF

## Human Abstract:
Background We aimed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people with Diabetes or hypertension, estimate the effect of cardiovascular comorbidities on HRQoL as well as compare HRQoL in these groups with that of healthy individuals. Methods A total of 9,070 respondents aged 18 years and over were assessed for HRQoL. Data were obtained from the Croatian Adult Health Survey. Respondents were divided into five groups according to their medical history: participants with hypertension (RR), hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities (RR+), Diabetes mellitus (DM), Diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (DM+) and participants free of these conditions (healthy individuals, HI).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our results showed an adverse impact of both diabetes and hypertension on participants' well-being and functioning, adding to current knowledge by the finding that the effect sizes are comparable, at least in the Croatian adult population. This could be useful in clinical practice, particularly in early treatment of diabetes and hypertension, at which point improving self-management and consequently HRQoL is still possible. We also found that cardiovascular comorbidities have a marked negative impact on HRQoL in people with both these conditions. Early recognition of participants with these chronic diseases might therefore be considered to be of importance, not only in clinical disease management, but also in participant education and empowerment aimed at improving their

The role of chondroitin in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in rats: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease characterised by fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and loss of lung function. Although the pathogenic pathways involved in IPF have not been fully elucidated, IPF is believed to be caused by repetitive alveolar epithelial cell injury and dysregulated repair, in which there is uncontrolled proliferation of lung fibroblasts and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which excessively deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the interstitial space. A number of profibrotic mediators including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-β are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IPF.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Nintedanib is an orally active small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been evaluated in large clinical trials for the treatment of IPF, a fatal disease in which the uncontrolled proliferation of lung fibroblasts and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts leads to progressive loss of lung function. This review describes the potent inhibitory activity of Nintedanib in several in vitro assays investigating mechanisms present in the pathology of lung fibrosis. The polypharmacology of Nintedanib on the receptors for FGF, PDGF and VEGF, and on non-receptor kinases like Src results in a broad inhibitory activity on the downstream signalling cascades of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and, potentially also on cells involved in angiogenesis in the lung (

## Human Abstract:
Background Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine and elevated in the regions of tissue injury and inflammatory diseases. The deleterious effects of TNF-α on fibroblasts may aggravate heart inflammation mediated through the up-regulation of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). However, the mechanisms underlying TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the roles of TNF-α in VCAM-1 expression and its effects on human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs). Results The primary culture HCFs were used in this study. The results obtained with Western blotting, real time-quantitative PCR, and promoter activity analyses showed that TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression was mediated through TNF receptor (TNFR) 1-dependent gene
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we reported here that TNF-α induced the expression of VCAM-1 gene in HCFs. The TNFR1, c-Src, EGFR, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB cooperatively mediated these effects of TNF-α. Based on the observations from literatures and our findings, Fig. 7b depicts a model for the signaling mechanisms implicated in TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression in HCFs. These findings suggest that TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression might play a critical role in heart inflammatory disorders mediated through c-Src-dependent transactivation of EGFR, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB signaling pathways in HCFs. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of TNF-α action on HCFs to up-regulate the VCAM-1 expression and then amplified the inflammatory responses, supporting the hypothesis that TNF-α may play a key role in the development of

## System Abstract:
Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation. Methods This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were divided into two groups (n = 84). The primary endpoint was based on the clinical outcomes and mortality rates. Results A total of 136 participants (mean ± 10. 2 %) were included in the first time, and Phase II trials.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation had the efficacy and safety of AF in the clinical practice. However, it may be useful for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Aims We investigated clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with significant valvular disease (SVD) in the rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) trial. Methods and results ROCKET AF excluded patients with mitral stenosis or artificial valve prostheses. We used Cox regression to adjust comparisons for potential confounders. Among 14 171 patients, 2003 (14.1 %) had SVD; they were older and had more comorbidities than patients without SVD. The rate of stroke or systemic embolism with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin was consistent among patients with SVD [ 2.01 vs. 2.43% ; hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55–1.27 ] and without SVD (1.96 vs. 2.22% ; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75–1.07; interaction P = 0.76
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In the ROCKET AF trial, every seventh patient had SVD. This proportion is probably a low estimate of the prevalence of SVD in clinical practice. 16 – 21 Importantly, AF patients with SVD experienced the same stroke-prevention benefit from oral anticoagulants as did AF patients without SVD. The quantitative interaction in bleeding rates that were higher with rivaroxaban than with warfarin in patients with SVD requires special attention and careful use of rivaroxaban in these patients. Therefore, SVD patients, except for those with haemodynamically significant mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic heart valves, represent an important part of the spectrum of non-valvular AF to which the results of trials of oral anticoagulants apply, at least as far as the use of rivaroxaban is

## Human Abstract:
Objective To investigate whether there is an increased risk of cardiac events in diabetic patients with a combined therapy of CLOpidogrel (CLO) and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) after drug-eluting stent (DES) deployment. Methods By using National Health Insurance Research Database, all patients who received CLO with or without PPI therapy within 90 days after undergoing DES (limus-eluting or paclitaxel-eluting stents) deployment were enrolled. Endpoints were acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and readmission for revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery) after 3, 6, and 12 months.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We demonstrated that the adjunctive use of PPIs for the duration of CLO treatment increases the rate of rehospitalization due to ACS in diabetic patients after LES implantation. The use of PPIs in addition to CLO should be undertaken with caution in all diabetic patients with DES deployment, especially LES. We hope that our observation will stimulate future prospective trials to address this important clinical question

Effect of Hypothermia on the treatment of brain injury in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background It is unknown whether Whole-Body hypothermia (WBH) affects pulmonary function. In vitro studies, at relatively low temperatures, suggest that hypothermia may induce significant changes to the Surfactant composition. The effect of WBH on Surfactant kinetics in newborn infants is unknown. We studied in vivo kinetics of disaturated-Phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in asphyxiated newborns during WBH and in normothermic controls (NTC) with no or mild asphyxia. Both groups presented no clinically apparent lung disease. Methods Twenty-seven term or near term newborns requiring mechanical ventilation were studied (GA 38.6±2.2 wks).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary the present study examined the kinetics of DSPC in late preterm and term newborns with healthy lung during WBH. DSPC HL and PS did not significantly differ by lowering body temperature to 33.5°C compared to normothermic controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate the kinetics of DSPC during WBH in case of lung injury

Cardiovascular and Hepatic Toxicity of Cocaine: Potential Beneficial Effects of Modulators of Oxidative stress
## Entities:
Oxidative stress; cocaine; cardiovascular and hepatic toxicity; Cardiovascular and Hepatic Toxicity; Cocaine
## System Abstract:
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Oxidative stress on Cocaine use in the treatment of cocaine. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group A, Saline, and 15 healthy controls. They were treated with either 0. 9% O 2 (10 mg/kg) or saline (500 mg/day) for 7 days. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that the addition of the selective inhibitor of the drug was evaluated by the emulsion.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that Oxidative stress could suppress Cocaine use in the treatment of cocaine. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.
## System New Title:
The role of Oxidative stress in the treatment of cocaine: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Oxidative stress (OS) is thought to play an important role in the pharmacological and toxic effects of various drugs of abuse. Herein we review the literature on the mechanisms responsible for the cardiovascular and hepatic toxicity of Cocaine with special focus on OS-related mechanisms. We also review the preclinical and clinical literature concerning the putative therapeutic effects of OS modulators (such as N-acetylcysteine, superoxide dismutase mimetics, nitroxides and nitrones, NADPH oxidase inhibitors, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and mitochondriotropic antioxidants) for the treatment of Cocaine toxicity. We conclude that available OS modulators do not appear to have clinical efficacy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In the present paper, several studies were reported demonstrating the important role of OS in the activity and toxicity of cocaine with special attention to its cardiovascular and hepatic effects. Several evidences were reported showing the potential beneficial effects of antioxidants or modulators of OS (as they are referred to considering their possible prooxidant effects in certain conditions) even if it should be kept in mind that, like in the case of NAC, their mechanism of action, which is often complex and not always fully elucidated, is not only related to their antioxidant activity.

## Entities:
type; metabolic syndrome; diabetes; Diabetes; cardiovascular disease
## System Abstract:
Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of metabolic syndrome and its components on cardiovascular disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting Outpatient participants were randomised to receive placebo or 2. 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and insulin resistance.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that metabolic syndrome and its impact on the risk of CHD in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results of this meta-analysis showed that placebo may be an independent predictor of CVD and cardiovascular events in T2D. However, it is not clear to confirm these findings.

Association between serum uric levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Patients with the metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop type 2 Diabetes and may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.We aimed to establish whether CVD event rates were influenced by the metabolic syndrome as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and to determine which component (s) of the metabolic syndrome (MS) conferred the highest cardiovascular risk in in 4900 patients with type 2 Diabetes allocated to placebo in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
An increasing number of MS variables increased future CVD risk, and for all definitions, other than the IDF definition, the risk of CVD among patients defined as having MS was significantly higher than among those without. The two MS variables that contributed most to this risk were HDL-c and hypertension. Waist measurement was not a material contributor. Of current definitions of MS, the WHO definition, which includes albuminuria, was consistently the best discriminator of risk, whereas the IDF definition was not significantly predictive. These results can help guide clinicians in identifying patients with diabetes at high CVD risk

## Human Abstract:
The high consumption of olive tree products in the Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower incidence of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. In particular, the protective effects of olive oil have been attributed to the presence of polyphenols such as Oleuropein (Ole) and its derivatives. We have synthesized a peracetylated derivative of Ole (Ac-Ole) which has shown in vitro antioxidant and growth-inhibitory activity higher than the natural mOlecule. In this study, male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice were fed with a standard (std), cafeteria (caf) diet, and caf diet supplemented with Ole (0.037 mmol/kg/day) and Ac-Ole (0.025 mmol/kg/day) for 15 weeks.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, these findings demonstrate, in this experimental model of metabolic damage caused by caf diet, the beneficial effects of Ac-Ole, exerted at even lower dose in mOles than Ole. Further studies, including the administration of different dosages of Ac-Ole and even for shorter periods will allow characterizing the mOlecular mechanism involved in such an action, in view of a potential use of this compound for prevention of human metabolic disorders

## Human Abstract:
Introduction Left atrial mass has been known to have a benign course. Case description A 55-year-old Asian woman visited to our hospital because of right sided hemiparesis and sudden vision loss in her left eye. She diagnosed as acute cerebral infarction and central retinal artery occlusion by several studies. We detected a large mass in the left atrium and thought this mass as thrombus causing multiple emboli. But her neurologic symptom was aggrevated during therapy and coronary computed tomography angiogram suggested a left atrial myxoma, not thrombus. She underwent the resection of the myxoma. Discussion and evaluation Sometimes it could be fatal because it could be source of systemic embolization.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We report this case of multiple embolism including central retinal artery occlusion caused by left atrial myxoma that mistook as the cardiac thrombus. Physicians should consider the possibility of myxoma in patient with retinal occlusion and timely management will be beneficial for better outcomes and prognosis. In addition, our report will let ophthalmologists know that cardiac myxoma can cause retinal artery occlusion and proper treatment for myxoma is very important for visual capacity

The Relationship between endothelial dysfunction and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
OBJECTIVE Although Magnesium may favorably affect metabolic outcomes, few studies have investigated the role of Magnesium intake in systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in humans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Among 3,713 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study and free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at baseline, we measured plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), turnor necrosis factor-α receptor 2 (TNF-α-R2), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and E-selectin.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In this large, ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal women, dietary magnesium intake was inversely associated with plasma concentrations of hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α-R2, sVCAM-1, and E-selectin independent of known risk factors for metabolic outcomes. Adjustment for dietary fiber intake attenuated but did not significantly alter these associations except in the case of E-selectin. After further adjustment for fruit and vegetable intake, folate intake, and saturated and trans fat intake, these inverse trends remained significant for hs-CRP, IL-6, and sVCAM-1, suggesting that dietary magnesium may influence concentrations of these biomarkers independently of other dietary factors associated with inflammation.

## Human Abstract:
Background Tuberculosis is considered the second most common cause of death due to infectious agent. The currently preferred regimen for treatment of pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) is isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, which has been used either as separate tablets (ST) or as fixed-dose combination (FDC). To date, no studies have compared both regimens in Qatar. We aim to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of FDC and ST regimen for treating PTB, in addition to comparing safety and efficacy of FDC and ST regimens in patients with diabetes treated for TB.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Pulmonary TB patients treated with a 4-FDC using Rifafour® showed to have similar response to treatment to those treated with ST while maintaining a similar safety profile, except for visual adverse events that were more noticed in the ST than FDC. Diabetic patients treated with FDC had a faster AFB conversion than those treated with ST regimen. Also, more hepatotoxicity and gastric adverse events were seen among patients with diabetes. Since the current study was not powered to compare the efficacy and safety of FDC to ST, further investigation in this population is warranted

## Human Abstract:
Background We have previously shown that hyperuricemia plays an important role in the vascular complications of insulin resistance (IR). Here we investigated the effect of Xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition on the cardiac complications of IR. Methods IR was induced in rats by a high fructose high fat diet for 12 weeks. Allopurinol, a standard XO inhibitor, was administered in the last 4 weeks before cardiac hemodynamics and electrocardiography, serum glucose, insulin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), 8-isoprostane, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and XO activity were measured.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
XO inhibition by allopurinol alleviates cardiac diastolic dysfunction and ischemia associated with IR. Inhibition of hyperuricemia, low grade inflammation and the angiotensin system are suggested potential mechanisms for the observed cardiac protection. It remains to be determined whether the cardiac dysfunction observed is the consequence of one cytokine or of the combinatorial effects of multiple mediators, and the effect of blocking individual cytokines in this model may provide further mechanistic insight. The findings from this study suggest that Xanthine oxidase may provide a novel drug target for the treatment of cardiac complications associated with insulin resistance and diabetes

## System Abstract:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the most common cause of death among hospitalized patients with severe sepsis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between dementia and mortality. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), and a cohort of healthy controls. Blood samples were collected from the hospital admission to December 31, 2013. Demographic data, blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Incidence rate of hospitalization were determined using logistic regression model.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that COPD is associated with dementia and mortality in patients with severe sepsis. The results of this meta-analysis suggested that the prevalence of hospitalization is an independent risk factor for the development of death. The association between the two groups, the relationship between CRP and AST were not related to the severity of blood pressure. This is the first report of a retrospective analysis of the Taiwan population.

Recently developed technology permits to optimize simultaneously surface area, porosity, density, rigidity and surface morphology of chitin-derived materials of biomedical interest. Safe and ecofriendly disassembly of chitin has superseded the dangerous acid hydrolysis and provides higher yields and scaling-up possibilities: the chitosan nanofibrils are finding applications in reinforced bone scaffolds and composite dressings for dermal wounds. Electrospun chitosan nanofibers, in the form of biocompatible thin mats and non-wovens, are being actively studied: composites of gelatin + chitosan + polyurethane have been proposed for cardiac valves and for nerve conduits; fibers are also manufactured from electrospun particles that self-assemble during subsequent freeze-drying.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This bibliographic survey shows the high viability of basic chemical and physical sciences that are promoting the applicability of chitin and chitosan in a number of demanding areas. Just in the most recent years a real interface of existing technologies and chitin science has taken place, and moreover new technologies are emerging in a few scattered articles (hot melt blending, processing, extrusion and stretching [ 112 – 115 ]; foaming [ 116 ]; electrofiltration [ 117 ]; decrystallization [ 118 ]; sonolysis, microfluidization and shearing [ 119 ]) that will certainly contribute to the exploitation of renewable chitin-bearing resources

The role of Rheumatoid arthritis in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the progressive destruction of joint causes morbidity. It is also associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, which can result in cardiovascular disease and mortality. The theRApeutic goal is to control the systemic inflammation to obtain not only the remission of symptoms, but also improve geneRAl state of health. Although recent biologic immunosuppressive theRApies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines have spawned a paRAdigm shift regarding the prognosis of RA, these theRApies possess inherent side effects. Also, early diagnosis of the disease remains confounded by uncertainty.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
H 2 is an inert gas present within the human body and is not classified as a medicine, but it has been shown to have theRApeutic and diagnostic potential for RA as discussed here. The appaRAtus for creating H 2 -enriched water (over 5 ppm of H 2) is already available commercially. The preventive effect of H 2 may be shown by those populations who drink the high H 2 water daily. Also, additional investigations of the benefits of H 2 for RA patients are urgently needed, as H 2 theRApy has tremendous potential, but is currently under-utilized and its benefits are not thoroughly explored.

## Human Abstract:
Background In patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is associated with death, shock and arrhythmias. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, structural and functional alterations of the left ventricle (LV) are highly prevalent, however, little is known about the impact of diabetes on RV characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether LV changes are paralleled by RV alterations in a rat model of diabetes. Methods Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and control (ZL) rats underwent echocardiography and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using [ 18 F ] -2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose under hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp conditions.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Whereas consequences of diabetes on the heart were previously restricted to the LV, this study showed that LV insulin-stimulated glucose utilisation and LV systolic function are paralleled by significant alterations in RV insulin-stimulated glucose utilisation and RV function in an experimental rat model of diabetes. RV dysfunction is associated with worse outcome in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and heart failure. The negative association of RV function with prognosis has only been scarcely investigated in the diabetic population. However, since diabetic patients are prone to develop diabetic cardiomyopathy and myocardial ischaemia [ 4 ], it might be suggested that RV dysfunction plays a central role in cardiac abnormalities in this

levosimendan Versus dobutamine in Myocardial Injury Patients with septic shock: A Randomized Controlled Trial
## Entities:
Septic Shock; myocardial injury; Dobutamine; Levosimendan; dobutamine; septic shock; Myocardial Injury; levosimendan
## System Abstract:
Background dobutamine is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with septic shock. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of levosimendan in preventing Myocardial Injury in the emergency department (ICU). Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a teaching hospital in a tertiary care center in Taiwan. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the titrated group (n = 32) or saline (95% confidence interval [ CI ]). The primary endpoint was the change in the incidence of the disease.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study suggest that levosimendan is safe and effective in the treatment of septic shock in patients with ICU.

Association between levosimendan and septic shock in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background We aimed to investigate the effect of levosimendan on biomarkers of Myocardial Injury and systemic hemodynamics in patients with septic shock. Material/Methods After achieving normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg, 38 septic shock patients with low cardiac output (left ventricular ejective fraction), LEVF ≤45 %) were randomly divided into two groups: levosimendan dobutamine. Patients in the levosimendan and dobutamine groups were maintained with intravenous infusion of levosimendan (0.2 μg/kg/minute) and dobutamine (5 μg/kg/minute) for 24 hours respectively. During treatment we monitored hemodynamics and LVEF, and measured levels of heart-type fatty acid binding protein (HFABP), troponin I (TNI), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Compared with Dobutamine, this study demonstrated Levosimendan reduced the level of biomarkers of myocardial injury including HFABP, TNI, and BNP, increased LVEF, strengthened systolic function, and improved systemic hemodynamics significantly in patients with septic shock; but there were no significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in ICU, or 28-day mortality between the two treatment groups. In conclusion, although Levosimendan improved the biomarkers of myocardial injury and hemodynamic parameters, our study failed to show any improvement in clinically relevant outcomes like length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 28-day mortality.

Association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and failure to monitor renal function with adverse outcomes in people with diabetes: a primary care cohort study
## Entities:
CKD; diabetes; Chronic kidney disease; Chronic Kidney Disease; chronic kidney disease
## System Abstract:
Background chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the association of renal function in people with diabetes remains controversial. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study. Setting The National Health Insurance Research Database was used to evaluate associations with eGFR and susceptibility to adverse events and mortality in patients with type 2 DM. We estimated the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and the Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to determine the prevalence and progression of outcomes.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that renal function are associated with increased risk of CKD in patients with type 2 DM. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Association between serum levels and risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. We investigate the relationship between CKD stage, proteinuria, hypertension and these adverse outcomes in the people with diabetes. We also study the outcomes of people who did not have monitoring of renal function. Methods A cohort of people with type 1 and 2 diabetes (N = 35,502) from the Quality Improvement in chronic kidney disease (QICKD) cluster randomised trial was followed up over 2.5 years. A composite of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and end stage renal failure comprised the outcome measure.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
CKD and proteinuria are associated with worse health outcomes in people with diabetes, and this effect is additive. People with diabetes, who are not monitored for renal disease, have an increased risk of adverse events and appear to receive suboptimal medical therapy

Presence of Late gadolinium Enhancement by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Among Patients With Suspected cardiac sarcoidosis Is Associated With Adverse Cardiovascular Prognosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
## Entities:
cardiac sarcoidosis; gadolinium; Adverse Cardiovascular Prognosis; Cardiac Sarcoidosis; sarcoidosis
## System Abstract:
Background Late magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to be associated with gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis (SLE). The aim of this systematic review was to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of sarcoidosis (CCRT) on the extent of Suspected. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of newly diagnosed on the cardiac function of the disease. Results. The primary outcome was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0. 001) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this meta-analysis indicate that newly diagnosed LGE in patients with SLE with Suspected (CCRT) was found to be effective in reducing the extent of the cardiac function in the control group. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no significant difference in the pathogenesis of the disease and progression of sarcoidosis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Individuals with cardiac sarcoidosis have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and death. Several small cohort studies have evaluated the ability of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict adverse cardiovascular events. However, studies have yielded inconsistent results, and some analyses were underpowered. Therefore, we sought to systematically review and perform meta-analysis of the prognostic value of cardiac MRI for patients with known or suspected cardiac sarcoidosis. Methods and Results We systematically searched for cohort studies of patients with known sarcoidosis with suspected cardiac involvement who underwent cardiac MRI with LGE with at least 12 months of either prospective or retrospective follow-up data regarding post-MRI adverse cardiovascular
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The presence of LGE on cardiac MRI among patients with known or suspected CS provides strong prognostic information with regard to future all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and ventricular arrhythmia. Although the presence of LGE in 29% of patients was associated with a high rate of adverse events, the absence of any LGE offered the reassurance of a low-risk prognosis of ventricular arrhythmia or cardiovascular death

Association between Anemia and risk factors in patients with Chronic kidney disease: A prospective cohort study.


## Human Abstract:
Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been linked to higher heart failure (HF) risk. anemia is a common consequence of CKD, and recent evidence suggests that anemia is a risk factor for HF. The purpose of this study was to examine among patients with HF, the association between CKD, anemia and inhospital mortality and early readmission. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study in two Swiss university hospitals. Subjects were selected based the presence of ICD-10 HF codes in 1999. We recorded demographic characteristics and risk factors for HF. CKD was defined as a serum creatinine ≥ 124 956; mol/L for women and ≥ 133 μmol/L for men.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, we found further evidence that the concomitant presence of either CKD or Anemia increased the risk of dying in the hospital or of being readmitted within 30 days among patients hospitalized with heart failure. The association persisted after controlling for other factors associated with adverse outcomes in these patients

Background Disturbances of the circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion are associated with Depression, coronary calcification, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The primary aim of this study was to test the associations between midnight salivary cortisol (MSC), Depression and HbA1c, and control for behavioural, environmental and intra individual factors with possible impact on cortisol secretion, like smoking, physical inactivity, season, medication, Diabetes duration, severe hypoglycemia episodes, age and gender in patients with type 1 Diabetes. Secondary aims were to present MSC levels for a reference group of non-depressed type 1 Diabetes patients with a healthy life style (physically active and non-smoking), and to explore seasonal
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
High levels of MSC linked to Depression, smoking and physical inactivity highlights three main targets in diabetes care, as a disturbance of the circadian rhythm of cortisol is associated with coronary calcification, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 13, 14 ]. The additional link between Depression and high HbA1c emphasizes the severity of Depression in patients with type 1 diabetes. Routine systematic Depression evaluation at diabetes control visits is suggested. A high cortisol level may help to emphasize to medical professionals and patients alike the necessity of taking action against Depression, smoking and physical inactivity

## System Abstract:
Background: Emerging evidence suggests that Paclitaxel is an effective first-line therapy for patients with advanced Breast cancer. However, the efficacy and safety of epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) and Pertuzumab (ABCB1) inhibitors have been shown to predict progression-free survival (OS). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of combination on Trastuzumab (GC) and paclitaxel (PTX) in Patients with HER2-Positive (NSCLC). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 118 consecutive Breast Cancer With the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

## Human Abstract:
The results of a preplanned cardiac safety analysis of global longitudinal strain (GLS), and troponin-I (TnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in the phase II study of Paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (THP) for metastatic HER2-positive Breast cancer are reported. There were no statistically significant changes in GLS, and TnI and BNP levels. The finding supports the cardiac safety of THP in this group of patients. Introduction. Myocardial strain imaging and blood biomarkers have been proposed as adjuncts to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) monitoring for the early detection of cardiotoxicity during cancer therapy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The combination treatment of a taxane with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the metastatic setting has led to significant improvements in outcomes with a very low cardiac toxicity profile [ 10, 20 ]. The absence of any significant changes of LVEF, global longitudinal strain, or cardiac biomarkers (TnI or BNP) in our study further supports the excellent cardiac safety of this treatment regimen.

## System Abstract:
Background Circulating monocytes (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between adiponectin levels and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in Overweight cells. Methods We performed a cross sectional, observational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to find out whether IL-1β and IL-6 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis (IHC). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with normal controls (n = 8), and obese volunteers.

Association between adiponectin and Adiponectin function in rats with Rheumatoid Arthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background adiponectin has insulin-sensitizing and anti-atherosclerotic effects, partly mediated through its action on monocytes. We aimed to determine adiponectin levels and expression of its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in peripheral monocytes from Overweight and obese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods Fifty-five Overweight/obese patients, suspected for CAD, underwent coronary angiography: 31 were classified as CAD patients (stenosis ≥ 50% in at least one main vessel) and 24 as nonCAD. Quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry were used for determining mRNA and protein surface expression of adiponectin receptors in peripheral monocytes.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary our data provide evidence that mRNA and surface expression of the Adiponectin receptors in human monocytes seems to be subjected to different regulatory mechanisms in states of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the latter states are associated with lower Adiponectin plasma levels and a decrease in surface expression of Adiponectin receptors in monocytes. This, in turn could aggravate the anti-atherogenic action of Adiponectin in CAD patients

Background Nrf2 is the most common malignancy in the world, which is characterized by the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is a causative factor for the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of microglial activation in the lung and lungs of the airways. Methods A 69-year-old transgenic mouse model was employed to determine the effect of ROS on the migration and progression of fibrosis in vitro and in vivo.

The role of Th2 in the rat model of fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and lethal disorder. Although the precise mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis are not fully understood, oxidant/antioxidant and Th1/Th2 balances may play an important role in many of the processes of inflammation and fibrosis. The transcription factor Nrf2 acts as a critical regulator for various inflammatory and immune responses by controlling oxidative stress. We therefore investigated the protective role of Nrf2 against the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Methods To generate pulmonary fibrosis, both wild-type C57BL/6 mice and Nrf2-deficient mice of the same background were administered bleomycin intratracheally. Results The survival of Nrf2-deficient mice after bleomycin administration was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The present study showed that Nrf2 protects against the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by regulating the cellular redox level and Th1/Th2 balance. Nrf2 has an advantage over a single antioxidant molecule for the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, since Nrf2 coordinately induces a variety of self-defense genes, including antioxidant and phase II enzymes. In addition, Nrf2 is expressed abundantly in macrophages, cells which are easily collected by BAL. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are lethal disorders for which effective therapeutic approaches are not readily available. Although transcription factor regulation therapy cannot currently be used for the treatment of these diseases, we believe that the present results may lead to new

## Human Abstract:
Background Hyperkalemia is a frequently observed electrolyte imbalance in dehydrated neonatal diarrheic calves that can result in skeletal muscle weakness and life‐threatening cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias. Hypothesis Intravenous administration of a small‐volume hypertonic NaHCO 3 solution is clinically more effective in decreasing the plasma potassium concentration (c K) in hyperkalemic diarrheic calves than hypertonic NaCl or Glucose solutions. Animals Twenty‐two neonatal diarrheic calves with c K 5.8 mmol/L. Methods Prospective randomized clinical trial. Calves randomly received either 8.4% NaHCO 3 (6.4 mL/kg BW; n = 7), 7.5% NaCl (5 mL/kg BW; n = 8), or 46.2% Glucose (5 mL/kg BW; n = 7) IV over 5 minutes and were subsequently allowed to suckle 2 L of an electrolyte
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Hypertonic (8.4 %) sodium Bicarbonate solution has a sound physiologic basis in the initial treatment of neonatal hyperkalemic diarrheic calves, as those solutions induce rapid plasma volume expansion, correct concomitant acidemia and have a marked and sustained potassium‐lowering effect. Results of the present study suggest a treatment advantage of sodium Bicarbonate over the use of a hypertonic Sodium Chloride infusion with an identical sodium load, indicating that alkalinization is an effective potassium‐lowering mechanism. Acidemic neonatal diarrheic calves can release considerable amounts of insulin in response to a hyperglycemic Glucose challenge, which resulted in a similar decline in c K than in calves after administration of sodium Bicarbonate.

## System Abstract:
Background Imatinib (pulmonary hypertension) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a new strategy to identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of a series of duodenal pulmonary artery disease (CTEPH), and to determine whether the presence of pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy was achieved by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primary endpoint was the standard of the treatment response rate and survival (OS).

## System Abstract:
Background The microsatellite gene expression of Arsenic (HO-1) is a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between GT-repeat polymorphism (SNP) and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CAD) in relation to the development of carotid atherosclerosis (RA). Methods We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the contribution of a single dose of 25 (OH) D 2 ] in the heme oxygenase-1 of carotid arteries. We also examined the associations between these two polymorphisms and the underlying mechanisms.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In conclusion, our findings suggest that SNP is an independent risk factor for the development of CAD in RA.

Association between SNP and heme oxygenase-1 in a rat model of CAD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background Arsenic is a strong stimulus of heme oxygenase (HO) -1 expression in experimental studies in response to oxidative stress caused by a stimulus. A functional GT-repeat polymorphism in the HO-1 gene promoter was inversely correlated to the development of coronary artery disease in diabetics and development of restenosis following angioplasty in patients. The role of this potential vascular protective factor in carotid atherosclerosis remains unclear. We previously reported a graded association of Arsenic exposure in drinking water with an increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between HO-1 genetic polymorphism and the risk of atherosclerosis related to Arsenic.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Results of this exploratory study suggest that at a relatively high arsenic exposure level, carriers of the short (GT) n allele (containing < 27 repeats) in the HO-1 gene promoter may have a smaller carotid atherosclerosis risk than non-carriers. To confirm our results, further studies are warranted using a larger sample with improved effect estimates, as well as samples of other arsenic-exposed populations with different ethnic backgrounds. A follow-up study must also be carried out on relationships among the HO-1 lenGTh polymorphism, long-term arsenic exposure, and adverse cardiovascular events

## System Abstract:
Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in millions of people worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aclidinium bromide (IND/GLY) fumarate (LABA) and formoterol (forced expiratory volume) in a fixed-dose combination of a fixed dose of a surrogate marker of symptoms. Methods CID was defined as ≥100% (IL) and post-hoc analyses (n = 53). Results Between 2006 and December 2009, a total of 89 patients were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Prevalence of COPD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background The combination of aclidinium bromide, a long-acting anticholinergic, and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (400/12 μg twice daily) achieves improvements in lung function greater than either monotherapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is approved in the European Union as a maintenance treatment. The effect of this combination on symptoms of COPD and exacerbations is less well established. We examined these outcomes in a pre-specified analysis of pooled data from two 24-week, double-blind, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised Phase III studies (ACLIFORM and AUGMENT).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We have shown that a novel, BID FDC of aclidinium and formoterol, administered over six months, significantly improves endpoints that are important to patients with COPD, namely, symptoms (TDI; daily, night-time and early-morning symptoms), relief-medication use and both reported and unreported exacerbations (moderate or severe exacerbations measured by HCRU and exacerbations of any severity measured by EXACT). Improvements in lung function with the FDC versus monotherapy were expected, in line with other recent combination data. However, pooling data from two studies of near-identical design has allowed a more comprehensive investigation of the benefits of the FDC in terms of symptoms and exacerbations.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of ischemic preconditioning on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Animals were divided into four groups: control group (CTL), heart failure (TC), and myocardial infarction (ST). The animals were followed by reperfusion (ECG). The primary outcome was a significant increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the QT interval (QTc), and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, this study demonstrated that ischemic preconditioning protects against I/R injury in vitro and in vivo.

## Human Abstract:
Background The susceptibility of hypertrophied myocardium to ischemia-reperfusion injury is associated with increased risk of postoperative arrhythmias. We investigate the effects of ischemic preconditioning (IP) on post-ischemic reperfusion arrhythmias in hypertrophic rabbit hearts. Methods Thirty-three rabbit models of myocardial hypertrophy were randomly divided into three groups of 11 each: non-ischemia-reperfusion group (group A), ischemia-reperfusion group (group B), and ischemic preconditioning group (group C). Another ten healthy rabbits with normal myocardium served as the healthy control group. Rabbit models of myocardial hypertrophy were induced by abdominal aortic banding.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our study suggests that the incidence of ischemia/reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in hypertrophic rabbit hearts decreases after IP, which plays an important antiarrhythmic role in hypertrophied myocardium during ischemia-reperfusion by maintaining the integrity of its electrophysiological features such as the up-regulation in Cx43 expression area. As it is known that Cx43 can quickly translocate between several organelles under pathologic conditions such as ischemia, the changes in membrane connexin or gap junction plaque density should be further elucidated by other techniques such as RT-PCR, which will be reported in future work

## System Abstract:
Background We aimed to explore the association of Cytomegalovirus (TB) and Stroke in adult patients with HIV/AIDS (CHD). Methods We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of the National Health Insurance Research Database. Eligible participants were stratified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9-CM) code (n = 95), and the risk of bias. The primary endpoint was the first time of the disease and the diagnosis of HIV infection. Results. The odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean (CI) levels were significantly higher in the general population.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In this study, we found that the association between TB and Stroke levels in adult patients with CHD. These findings suggest that the risk of HIV infection may be an independent predictor for the diagnosis and prevention of the disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.

## Human Abstract:
Objectives Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection might increase the risk of cardiovascular event. However, data on the link between incident Stroke and co-infections of CMV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are limited and inconsistent. This nationwide population-based cohort study analyzed the association of CMV end-organ disease and Stroke among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Methods From January 1, 1998, this study identified adult HIV individuals with and without CMV end-organ disease in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. All patients were observed for incident Stroke and were followed until December 31, 2012.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This nationwide, long-term cohort study revealed a link between CMV end-organ disease and Stroke among PLWHA. CMV end-organ disease was associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause Stroke. When type of Stroke was considered, CMV iend-organ disease was significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic Stroke but not hemorrhagic Stroke. These findings suggest that CMV end-organ disease was an independent predictor of ischemic Stroke among PLWHA

## Human Abstract:
Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of T1 mapping at rest and during adenosine stress as a novel method for ischemia detection without the use of gadolinium contrast. Background In chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), accurate detection of ischemia is important because targeted revascularization improves clinical outcomes. Myocardial blood volume (MBV) may be a more comprehensive marker of ischemia than myocardial blood flow. T1 mapping using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is highly sensitive to changes in myocardial water content, including MBV. We propose that T1 mapping at rest and during adenosine vasodilatory stress can detect MBV changes in normal and diseased myocardium in
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
adenosine stress and rest T1 mapping can differentiate between normal, infarcted, ischemic, and remote myocardial tissue classes with distinctive T1 profiles. Stress/rest T1 mapping on CMR holds promise for ischemia detection without the need for gadolinium contrast. Perspectives COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: adenosine stress and rest T1 mapping is a novel CMR technique that reflects changes in myocardial blood volume through its water content. This proof-of-principle study showed for the first time that stress and rest T1 mapping can differentiate between normal, infarcted, ischemic, and remote myocardium with distinctive T1 profiles, which holds promise for ischemia detection using CMR without the need for gadolinium Contrast Agents.

Effects of ulcers on wound healing in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background: Venous ulcers are wounds that are thought to occur due to improper functioning of venous valves, usually of the legs. They are the major cause of chronic wounds, occurring in 70% to 90% of chronic wound cases. The treatment of venous ulcers also entails substantial costs. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a simple office based procedure which helps in enhancing the wound healing by releasing many growth factors like platelet derived growth factors, fibroblast derived growth factors and epidermal growth factors. Aim: To study the efficacy of autologous platelet rich plasma in the management of chronic venous ulcer.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Chronic venous leg ulcers come with cost and morbidity for patients and society also. PRP is a safe, simple, inexpensive and biocompatible procedure. In our study, PRP is found to be useful in enhancing the wound healing in chronic venous leg ulcers without any adverse events. Since, there is no standardization of the procedure, more randomized control studies are needed to make a standard protocol for the preparation of PRP

Acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism in a young man with pernicious anemia-induced severe hyperhomocysteinemia
## Entities:

## System Abstract:
Background myocardial infarction is a rare cause of acute coronary artery disease. We report a case of a young man with pernicious anemia-induced severe hyperhomocysteinemia who presented with sudden onset of syncope and pulmonary embolism. Case Report: A 47-year-old female came to our emergency department with transthoracic echocardiography. He had a history of right heart failure and thrombosis. He was diagnosed with a diagnosis of chest pain. She was admitted to our hospital because he had never been reported. The patient was treated with simvastatin and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed a significant increase in the left ventricular mass index (BMI) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (HR).
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, we report a case of a young man with pernicious anemia-induced severe hyperhomocysteinemia and pulmonary embolism. We believe that a patient with simvastatin and methylprednisolone therapy should be considered as a cause of suspicion.

The role of myocardial infarction in patients with acute ST: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
A 27 year-old man who presented to the hospital with progressive lower extremity weakness, developed an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction on his second hospital day. Primary angioplasty to the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed. Due to persistent dyspnea, the patient underwent a diagnostic chest computed tomography which confirmed multiple small pulmonary emboli. Laboratory analysis revealed a megaloblastic anemia with a reduced vitamin B12 level and positive titers for antibodies against intrinsic factor, establishing a diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Screening for hypercoaguable markers documented an isolated severely elevated homocysteine levels (105 μmol/l).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This case clearly demonstrates that vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia may lead to a severely elevated homocysteine levels that can be rapidly corrected with vitamin B12 supplements. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia can be a risk factor for endothelial damage, vascular inflammation and thrombus formation leading to pulmonary emboli and in-situ coronary artery thrombus formation. We conclude that severe hyperhomocysteinemia needs to be considered in the work-up of acute myocardial infarction not explained by atherosclerotic heart disease. Although studies have shown no preventive benefit from correcting mildly elevated homocysteine levels, severe elevation in homocysteine level should be corrected with appropriate vitamin therapy to prevent vascular complications

Introduction The anti-anginal efficacy of Ivabradine is well established. We describe a post hoc analysis in the ADDITIONS database to investigate effectiveness and tolerability of Ivabradine in combination with beta-blocker in patients with angina who have had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods ADDITIONS was a non-interventional, multicenter prospective study including 2,330 patients with stable angina. In addition to beta-blocker, patients were treated with Ivabradine in approved dosages for 4 months. We divided the population according to whether they had previously had a PCI or not, and explored the effect of Ivabradine on heart rate, number of weekly angina attacks, frequency of nitrate consumption, as well as quality of life (QoL) and
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The addition of Ivabradine to medical therapy, including beta-blockers, for the treatment of stable angina was effective and well tolerated, independent of PCI status. Many patients with a previous PCI have recurring symptoms of angina. Ivabradine should be considered as an important therapeutical option in the treatment of symptomatic stable angina as it reduced the frequency of weekly angina attacks and nitrate usage, led to an improvement in CCS class and a substantial improvement in the QoL of patients with stable angina.

## Human Abstract:
Researchers are finding it more and more difficult to follow the changing status of disease candidate genes due to the exponential increase in gene mapping studies. The Text-mined Hypertension, obesity and Diabetes candidate gene database (T-HOD) is developed to help trace existing research on three kinds of cardiovascular diseases: Hypertension, obesity and Diabetes, with the last disease categorized into Type 1 and Type 2, by regularly and semiautomatically extracting HOD-related genes from newly published literature. Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for Hypertension, obesity and Diabetes, respectively.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining systems and verified by domain experts. In addition, T-HOD not only extracts candidate gene names but also looks up their Entrez Gene IDs and rs numbers for integrating information of candidate gene properly. In summary, the literature-based candidate gene database consists of HOD-related candidate genes and includes the following features: (i) up-to-date candidate genes and SNPs information; (ii) a context sentence for each extracted gene; (iii) visualization of candidate genes ’ interaction; (iv) annual statistics for the number of HOD candidate genes and (v) a feedback interface that allows T-HOD curators to comment on our extracted

Efficacy and safety of dyspnea in patients with myxoma: a case report.


## Human Abstract:
Primary heart neoplasms are rare occurring with an estimated incidence of 0.0017-0.19% . Myxoma is the most prevalent primary heart tumor. The right atrium is an unusual localization, occurring only in 15-20% of Myxoma cases. We report a rare case of a massive right atrial Myxoma causing tricuspid valve obstruction and presenting as syncope and exertional dyspnea. This case illustrates the influence of Myxoma's size, position and mobility as well as patient's body posture and respiration to the development of signs and symptoms. Three-dimensional echocardiography proved useful in surgery planning, allowing a better definition of the tumor outline and attachment.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, right atrial Myxomas are rare and syncope is a possible although uncommon clinical presentation. This case emphasizes the importance of Myxoma's size, position and mobility as well as patient's posture and respiration to the development of signs and symptoms. Right heart tumors should be considered in differential diagnosis of unexplained syncope. TTE is the fundamental diagnostic technique but 3 D echo may also prove helpful in surgery planning, allowing a better definition of the tumor outline, spatial relations and attachment

## Human Abstract:
Background Several studies have suggested that the specific stroke subtype may influence the presence of leukoaraiosis in patients with ischemic stroke. We investigated the association between stroke subtype and leukoaraiosis in Korean patients with ischemic stroke by MRI. Methods There were 594 patients included in this study that were classified as large artery disease, lacune and cardioembolic stroke. For large-artery disease, the analysis focused on the intracranial or extracranial location of the stenosis, and the multiplicity of the stenotic lesions. leukoaraiosis grading was performed according to the atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Results There was a significant association between leukoaraiosis and the stroke subtypes; the large-artery-disease group had a higher prevalence of leukoaraiosis than did the other groups (55.4% in the large-artery-disease group, 30.3% in the lacunar group and 14.3% in the cardioembolic group, P = 0.016 by chi-square test
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study showed that LA is significantly associated with large-artery-disease rather than other stroke subtypes including small vessel disease in Korean stroke patients. The differences between our study and previous reports might be due to the high prevalence of intracranial occlusive lesions in patients with cerebrovascular atherosclerosis in the Asian population. Different from the high-grade stenoses of extracranial arteries, the stenoses of intracranial arteries might induce extensive white matter changes by interrupting blood flow to the periventricular border zone vulnerable to ischemia

## System New Title:
Association between Pneumonia and pneumonia in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis.


## Human Abstract:
Background While early Pneumonia is common in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), little is known about the impact of Pneumonia and the optimal timing of antibiotic therapy after OHCA. Methods We conducted a 5-year retrospective cohort study, including patients who suffered from OHCA and were treated with therapeutic hypothermia. ICU treatment was strictly standardized with defined treatment goals and procedures. Medical records, chest radiographic images and microbiological findings were reviewed. Results Within the study period, 442 patients were admitted to our medical ICU after successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest. Of those, 174 patients fulfilled all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and were included into final analysis.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Early Pneumonia occurs frequently in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after OHCA and may extend length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay. Importantly, diagnosis of Pneumonia in the setting of hypothermia after OHCA is challenging since common criteria cannot be taken into consideration (e.g., fever), are difficult to interpret (e.g., infiltrates on chest radiographies), or are available only with delay (microbiological findings). Only a PEEP value on day 1 above 10.5 mbar was found to be an early predictor of confirmed Pneumonia; other (more reliable) predictors could not be identified.

## System Abstract:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of phosphatidic acid on growth inhibition in human colon cancer cells and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Methods: In the present work, we examined the effect of Cyclic treatment on the expression of cAMP and Inhibits on the metabolism of cell lines. We evaluated the role of protein kinase (CK), a key enzyme inhibitor, and to determine the mechanism of the potential signaling pathway. In addition, we found that the transcription factor receptor 2 (P < 0. 001), a natural product, is a promising approach to reduce the proliferation and function of the disease.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our study demonstrated that phosphatidic acid treatment inhibited the expression of cAMP and Inhibits on the metabolism of cell lines. Our results suggest that administration of CK therapy may be a potential therapeutic target for treating colon cancer cells.

The role of cancer stem cell proliferation and invasion.


## Human Abstract:
Colon cancer is a malignancy that develops in colon and rectal tissues. The prognosis for metastatic colon cancer remains poor, and novel therapeutic options are required to reduce colon cancer mortality. Recently, intracellular cAMP levels have been suggested to influence the behavior of cancer cells. Intriguingly, cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) and its structural analogs inhibit growth in many cancer cell lines, and our previous work has suggested that cPA increases cAMP production. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 3 isoforms PDE3A and PDE3B are expressed mainly in cardiovascular tissue and adipose tissue, respectively. Moreover, increase in intracellular cAMP levels has been associated with the inhibition of growth in colon cancer cells.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
Our findings indicate that cAMP plays a critical role in the inhibition of Colon cancer cell growth by cPA. Based on our results, we suggest that elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which cPA induces cAMP production by inhibiting PDE3B in Colon cancer cells can provide valuable insights that help explain how cancer cell growth is regulated. Understanding how cancer cell growth is regulated would, in turn, help unravel the molecular mechanisms of cancer-cell invasion and metastasis and facilitate the analysis of the signal transduction pathways that lead to cell proliferation. Although further research is required for examining the crosstalk between the signaling molecules we have described here, our results collectively support the potential use of cPA as a therapeutic compound for treatment

## Human Abstract:
Myocarditis is a critical inflammatory disorder which causes life-threatening conditions. No specific or effective treatment has been established. DPP-4 inhibitors have salutary effects not only on type 2 diabetes but also on certain cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of a DPP-4 inhibitor on Myocarditis has not been investigated. To clarify the effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor on Myocarditis, we used an experimental Autoimmune Myocarditis (EAM) model in Balb/c mice. EAM mice were assigned to the following groups: EAM mice group treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor (linagliptin) (n = 19) and those untreated (n = 22).
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
A DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, prevented cardiac Fibrosis and attenuated Th1 cytokine expression in EAM. This finding suggests the possibility of using a DPP-4 inhibitor to alleviate Fibrosis in patients with Myocarditis

Introduction Coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) is an important prognostic marker in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Beta-blockers and Ivabradine have been shown to improve CFVR in patients with stable CAD, but their effects were never compared. The aim of the current study was to compare the effects of bisoprolol and Ivabradine on CFVR in patients with stable CAD. Methods Patients in sinus rhythm with stable CAD were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Patients had to be in a stable condition for at least 15 days before enrollment, on their usual therapy.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
This study shows for the first time in humans that Ivabradine significantly improves hyperemic peak CFV and CFVR to a greater extent than a beta-blocker, in patients with stable CAD, demonstrating that Ivabradine not only has an anti-anginal but also an anti-ischemic effect. Similar HR reduction obtained with both drugs implies that the effect of Ivabradine treatment goes beyond the HR. Differences between Ivabradine and bisoprolol could be due to a different effect on diastolic perfusion time and isovolumic ventricular relaxation, as well as unmasking of alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction by beta-blockers. Theoretically, an overall improvement of diastolic function and a positive effect on coronary collateral function could further explain differences between Ivabradine and beta-blockers on CFV and

High-dose Fasudil preserves postconditioning against myocardial infarction under hyperglycemia in rats: role of mitochondrial KATP channels
## Entities:
ATP; fasudil; myocardial infarction; Fasudil; hyperglycemia; myocardial infarct; Myocardial infarct
## System Abstract:
Background The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of High-dose Fasudil (postconditioning), a selective inhibitor of myocardial infarction (MI), and to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Methods We examined the effect of a single dose of fasudil on hyperglycemia in rats. The primary endpoint was a significant proportion of patients with liver transplantation (n = 10), and the control group received an oral glucose tolerance test (100 μg/kg). The animals were injected intraperitoneally (i. P.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that postconditioning may be a potential therapeutic target for mitochondrial dysfunction in rats.

## Human Abstract:
Background The current study was carried out to determine whether Fasudil hydrochloride (Fasudil), a Rho-kinase inhibitor, has myocardial postconditioning (PostC) activity under hyperglycemia as well as normoglycemia, and if so, whether the effects could be mediated by mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (m-KATP) channels. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. After opening the chest, all rats underwent 30-min coronary artery occlusion followed by 2-h reperfusion. The rats received low-dose (0.15 mg/kg) or high-dose (0.5 mg/kg) Fasudil or diazoxide, an m-KATP channel opener, at 10 mg/kg, just before reperfusion under normoglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
fasudil induces PostC against Myocardial infarction in the rat. This protective effect of fasudil is mediated by activation of m-KATP channels. Although hyperglycemia raises the threshold of fasudil-induced PostC, high-dose fasudil could preserve the protective effect

## Title:
Clinical significance of mTOR, ZEB1, ROCK1 expression in lung tissues of pulmonary fibrosis patients
## Entities:
mTOR; fibrosis; ZEB1; ROCK1; pulmonary fibrosis
## System Abstract:
Background mTOR is a member of the extracellular matrix and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of rapamycin (ZEB1) isoforms in lung fibrosis. Methods The expression of neuron-specific enolase (ROCK1) was analyzed by real-time PCR, western blotting, and histopathological analyses. Results Nineteen IPF patients were significantly higher than that of HIV infection (p < 0. 05). The patient was found to be fulfilled the most common cause of death in the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
In summary, our results suggest that ZEB1 isoforms may be a useful tool for treating lung fibrosis. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

## Human Abstract:
Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease of unknown causes. Three proteins (mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR; zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1, ZEB1; Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1, ROCK1) may be related to pulmonary fibrosis. However, they have not been assessed in human pulmonary fibrosis. We assessed the clinical significance of mTOR, ZEB1, and ROCK1 expression in human pulmonary fibrosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. Methods The mTOR, ZEB1, and ROCK1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of 30 surgical lung biopsy tissues from 26 IPF and 4 UIP pattern connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD )
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
We first demonstrated that mTOR, ZEB1 and ROCK1 was expressed in hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells of human pulmonary fibrosis lungs. Furthermore, mTOR and ZEB1 were associated with clinical outcomes such as lung function decline. Thus, mTOR and ZEB1 expression may be related with the prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis and disease progression. Because our patients included some patients with CTD-ILD, further studies involving large numbers of homogeneous IPF patients are warranted to determine whether mTOR and ZEB1 are true prognostic markers of pulmonary fibrosis

## System Abstract:
Patient: Male, New Final Diagnosis: Gastric breath Symptoms: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage Medication: — Clinical Procedure: Skin • Cardiology Objective: Rare disease Background: Prothrombin complex concentrate (IB) is a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Beriplex P/N (VWF) in patients with severe abdominal pain. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all cases of a tertiary referral center in a large part of this retrospective review. We performed a case of a 46-year-old man who visited our hospital for the last 3 months.
## System Conclusion and Future work:
The prevalence of VWF in patients with severe abdominal pain should be considered as a diagnostic tool for the management of IB in a patient with a history of dyspnea.

Efficacy and safety of bleeding: A case report and review of clinical trials.


## Human Abstract:
Introduction Major blood loss can often be life-threatening and is most commonly encountered in the settings of surgery and trauma. Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy are also at increased risk of bleeding. We investigated the use of a Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC; Beriplex P/N, CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) to treat severe bleeding in a variety of settings: cardiac surgery, warfarin therapy and other surgery. Methods Thirty consecutive patients who had received PCC were identified from blood transfusion records. For cardiac surgery and warfarin reversal, PCC was administered in accordance with hospital protocols.
## Human Conclusion and Future work:
The results of this study highlight a potential role for PCC in controlling bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and other surgical procedures. There is a paucity of clinical data for such broad use of PCC (including patients without underlying coagulopathy relating to OAT, haemophilia or liver dysfunction). Further investigation of bleeding in cardiac surgery and other surgical procedures would be needed to establish the optimal use of PCC in these settings
