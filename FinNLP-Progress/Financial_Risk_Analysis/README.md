| Theil et al. (2019) | [PRoFET: Predicting the Risk of Firms from Event Transcripts](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/724) | They present a new dataset of 90K earnings call transcripts [(open source)](https://github.com/samuelbroscheit/neural-profet) | BiLSTM | Linear correlation coefficient Pearson’s r, the Non-linear rank correlation coefficients Spearman’s ρ and Kendall’s τ, and the MSE | 2002–2017 | They introduce PRoFET, the first neural model for volatility prediction jointly exploiting both semantic language representations and a comprehensive set of financial features | IJCAI-19 |

| Yang et al. (2020) | [HTML: Hierarchical Transformer-based Multi-task Learning for Volatility Prediction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380128) | [Code](https://github.com/YangLinyi/HTML-Hierarchical-Transformer-based-Multi-task-Learning-for-Volatility-Prediction) | HTML (Hiererachical Transformer with Multi-task Learning) | MSE | S&P 500 companies in 2017 | Yang et al. (2020) is the first approach that can deal with the long-form financial documents for volatility prediction. This paper demonstrates very significant improvements in prediction accuracy, in the range 17% - 49% compared to the current state-of-the-art. | WWW-20 |
| Ye et al. (2020) | [Financial Risk Prediction with Multi-Round Q&A Attention Network](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/631) | 6494 text-only samples | Bidirectional LSTM | MSE | 2015-2018 | Instead of word-level or document level feature extraction, they focus on dialogues in the conference. Through extracting features of each round of dialogue, the model predicts the financial volatility. Compared to the most common baseline, past volatility, proposed model achieves 47% improvement in 3-days span, 31% in 7-days span, and 23% in 15-days span. | IJCAI-20 |
