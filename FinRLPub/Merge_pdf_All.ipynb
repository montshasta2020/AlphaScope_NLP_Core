       "' CS 230  \\nA Deep Learning Approach for Stock Market Prediction  \\n \\nYan Miao  \\nCompute r Science Department  \\nStanford Un iversity \\nyanmiao@stanford.edu  \\nAbstract  \\nThe project explores  a stock market prediction model using  a LSTM \\nnetwork . A  LSTM  model  with  different param eters  are  tested  to \\ndetermine  the  effect  of  number  of  hidden  layers,  dropout \\nregularization  and batch size on the  result accuracy . The model  is \\ntested on t he stock price  of Amazon, Google and Faceboo k.  \\n1 Introduction  \\nFinancial  time series are non-stationary,  nonlinear  and high-noise.  While individuals  and firms all \\nhave interests  in gaining  profits  from the stock market,  it is difficult  to predict  the trend of a stock’s  \\nprice by instinct.  Despite  the success  of classical  machine  learning  algorithms,  the evolution  of \\ndeep learning  has provide d new models  for researchers  to analyze  big data with cheap  computation  \\ndevices.  The input to my algorithm  is the daily price value of a stock in a chosen  time period. Then \\nI use a long short-term memory  (LSTM) recurrent  neural  network  to output the predicted  stock \\nprice.  \\n \\n2 Related Work  \\n \\nThe deep learning  neural  network  is a reliable  predictor  due to its ability  to approximate  nonlinear  \\nfunctions.  There already exists many papers  on this topic. For example,  Artificial  Neural  Networks  \\n(ANN)  are able to predict the stock price and direction  of movement  of the price [1][2]. \\nConvolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNN),  though  more frequently  used for image processing,  can \\nalso be used to predict  the stock movement  as a classification  model  with one day close,  open, \\nhigh, low, volume  data [3]. In his paper,  experiments  on a one-dimensional  convolutional  network  \\nwith three convolutional  layers using MaxPooling  and ReLu activation.  In particular,  LSTM neural  \\nnetworks  have the characteristics  of selectivity  and memory  cells that are suitable  for random  non-\\nstationary  sequences  like stock-price time series [4]. LSTM can store memory  and solve the \\ngradient  vanishing  problem.  The LSTM network  is also the most popular  model  adopted  right now. \\nIn a study that systematically  reviews  the Deep Learning  models  implemented  for stock market  \\nforecasting,  researchers  find that the LSTM technique  is widely  applied  (73.5%)  [5]. In this \\nproject,  an LSTM network  is implemented  to predict  the Amazon  stock price. Similar  works can \\nbe found here: [6][7][8] . \\n \\n3 Dataset  and Features  \\nThe experimental data comes from the data provided by Yahoo Finance.  The stock price is selected \\nfrom  January  28,  2015  to  January  29,  2020. Stocks  from  three companies  are  selected: \\nAmazon (AMZN ), Google( GOOG) and Facebook( FB). Such selection is to minimize unn ecessary \\ninfluences due to different industries.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the dataset, there are five features: the day of the transaction (date), the opening price value of \\nthe specified day (open), the closing price value of the specified day (close), the lowest price value \\nof the specified day (low), the highest price valu e of the specified day (high). For the project, the \\ngoal is to predict the “close” stock price value.  For each  dataset, there are 1260 entries in total.  The \\nfirst 800  entries are selected for training, and the  remaining  460 entries are used for testing.  Neural \\nnetworks are sensitive to unnormalized data.  Before training the model, the data was  rescaled  into \\nthe range of [0, 1] using Min -Max normalization  to make  the model more reliable . Then, each row \\nof the input matrix is a data  structure  with 30 time -steps. For training  input, the shape is ( 770, 30, \\n1) and for testing input, the shape   is (430, 30, 1 ). \\n4 Methods  \\nThe LSTM network  model  is implemented in this project . The structure of the me mory unit  of a \\nLSTM is demonstrated below. The memory unit operates  with input gate, forget gate a nd output \\ngate. The proce ss can be su mmarized as the following equations : \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHere i\\nt,  f\\nt and o\\nt are the outputs of different  gates,  S  ̃  \\nt is the new state of memory cell,  S\\nt is the \\nfinal sate of memory cell and  h\\nt is the final output  of the memory  unit. W\\ni,W\\nf ,W\\no,W\\ns, b\\ni, b\\nf ,b\\no \\nand b\\ns are coefficients.     Fig. Sample representation of dataset  \\nFig. LSTM Memory Unit [9] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable. Model Perfo rmance on Three Datasets   5 Experiments  \\nThe model is built with 50 neurons.  For each hidden layer in  the model, dropout regularization is \\nemployed.  Then, the model is compiled with  the MSE loss function and the Adam optimizer . Six \\nmodels  are tested  with differences in layers, dropout rate and batch size.  Models are te sted with 3 \\nand 4 hidden  layers, dropout rate  of 0.1 and  0.2, and batch size of 32 and 64.  The firs t model  is a \\nLSTM network  with 50 neurons, 3 layers , dropout rate of 0.2 and batch size of 32 . To test if a \\nsmaller dropout rate could improve t he model  error, dropo ut is reduced  to 0.1. To determine if a \\nsmaller number  of  layers is  enough,  one  layer  is removed  from  the  model.  Since  batch  size  is \\ncritical for LSTM to learn the common pattern,  models with different  batch size are also tested.  \\n \\nModel #  Neurons  Layers  Dropout  Batch Size  Epochs  \\n1  50  4  0.2  32  100 \\n2  50  4  0.1  32  100 \\n3  50  3  0.2  32  100 \\n4  50  3  0.1  32  100 \\n5  50  3  0.2  64  100 \\n6  50  3  0.1  64  100 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe metric s adopted for  model  performance  is the Root Mean  Squared  Error.  RMSE is comm only \\nused to measure  accuracy for forecasting. It penalize s big errors while small err ors can be safely \\nignored. This  choice  of  metrics  is  consistent  with  the  goal of  predicting stock  market  trend  to \\ngenerate  revenue s.  Below  is  a  plot  that  demonstrate  the  model  performance.

W hile batch size and dr opout \\nrate are the same (Model 1 vs. Model 3  and Model 2 vs. Model 4 ), a three-layer model  produce s \\nmore accurate result than  a four-layer model.  \\n \\n \\n   \\n\\n\\nFig. Model 4 Result on  Facebook ’s Stock \\nPrice  \\n\\nAccording to t he performance  metrics , Model 4  produces  the best res ult, while Model 2  gives the \\nlargest error value.  In addition,  Model 3  produces results almost similar to Model  4, and Model 6 \\nis next.  Therefore,  the project fin ds the best model to be a LSTM network with 50 neurons,  3 layers, \\ndropout rate of 0.1 and batch size  of 32. Interestingly,  the model  used in this project  seems to work  \\nparticular ly well on  Facebook ’s stock price, while  model s to predic t Amazon’s stock price  often \\nproduce  the highest error.  It might be  due to factors related with the financial market . \\n \\n6 Conclusion  \\n \\nIn this project,  we find that  the best  performing  algorithm is  a LSTM networ k with 50 neu rons, 3 \\nlayers, dropout r ate 0.1  and batch size 32.  If there  is more time, it will be interesting to investigat e \\nthe followin g two questions . The first question is  what is the effect of number of neurons on the \\nmodel?  All models in the project  have 50 neurons because they seem to wo rk well. It is worth \\nexploring  how  changing  the number  of  neurons will influence  the model ’s  performance.  The \\nsecond question  is how will  a different timestep influence the model?  All models  use a timeste p \\nof  30 during  data  processing.  While  intuitively  smaller  timesteps  should  create  more  accurate \\nresults,  it could take some experiments to determine  the effect of  timestep.    \\n\\nFig. Model 4 Result on Amazon’s Stock Price \\nRefere nces   \\n[1] Yakup Kara, Melek Acar Boyacioglu, and  Ömer Kaan Baykan.
