      "Knowledge Brief | No Content Left Behind: When to Extend File Sync / Share With ECM Menu Knowledge Brief | 12/1/2015 No Content Left Behind: When to Extend File Sync / Share With ECM As the needs of organizations grow more complex — and as they seek to extract more business value from their enterprise content than basic file sync and file share solutions can provide — Aberdeen’s analysis confirms that they are much less likely to rely solely on SharePoint, and much more likely to turn to full-fledged enterprise content management (ECM) solutions.

If we take the example of a retail business, it is necessary that we understand just how and to what level performance reports and field data inputs can be utilized to improve upon an existing business. A business’ success depends almost entirely on how efficiently their marketing strategy helps promote the product. Now, without accurate inputs about the market scenario, day to day data accumulation, visualization and analysis, an organization cannot design an appropriate strategy. In order for this to happen, it is necessary that the pertinence and relevance of field data is recognized by field team managers and other back end managers. But, most importantly, it is necessary to ensure that an adequate method has been narrowed down upon, such as mobile data collection software. Why this, you ask? An effective data collection software can both avoid and correct any discrepancies that may occur in manual field data reporting. Simultaneously, it also allows the field team to timely relay all essential data to their offsite managers who can then compare their reports to tweak the existing business strategy. While there are several mobile data collection apps and/or software in the market, we have compiled a list of the most effective data collection tools here: FReD aka Field Reporting Dude- With the desire of taking their field data reporting to the level and elevating the purpose of the acquired data, a number of leading companies across verticals have opted to utilize FReD. This particular app from 360 Field Reporting is specifically meant for retail businesses with an easily integrated module that serves field merchandising and retail audit requirements. With field data collected, transferred and analyzed in re al time, FReD allows a business to reach maximum efficiency in the form of field data collection software. The software can be integrated with an organization’s existing retail execution software and be made available on multiple devices simultaneously in order to allow field executives and managers to execute critical decisions speedily. It also hosts features such as GPS tagging, photo capture, merchandise management etc. Repsly Classic- Repsly Classic is a mobile CRM solution from Repsly Inc. It is a mobile data collection and management software designed keeping in mind the end user. This app also focuses upon helping businesses simplify their process of creating and sharing forms, data collection, appointment scheduling, order tracking etc. Repsly specifically focuses upon businesses where their operations recur between existing customers and the tasks assigned go full circle between order taking and replenishment time and again. While mobile data collection software such as FReD focus on helping the field team and the retail operators, Repsly focuses more upon decreasing the communication gap between the field team and their managers. iForm Builder- This is an all in one database based software which allows users to collect and track all data in the same location. Unlike FReD or Repsly, iForm Builder does not necessarily help businesses track and execute information in real time. It does not help the business owner and management to use field data while keeping track of merchandising requirements etc. altogether. Instead, this data collection app focuses on using data already collated and converting them into digital form for the ease of use by field executives and managers together. They can further use the data already entered to reference data required thus eliminating the need for manual records. Collect- Collect by Social Cops is another data collection app that is available on the Google Play store that focuses on helping a business convert all their manual data collection methods into the digital form. This app specifically works around or rather centers upon the usage of an android app for surveying and non- commercial data collection purposes. Looking to ease and secure data collection? Try one of our top ranking field data collection apps today!

Because more devices are becoming part of our everyday lives, there are more bits of data than ever before. A decade ago, big data was measured in terabytes (or 1,000 to the fourth power in the International System of Units), and today the measure has reached petabytes, or 1,000 times that size. Soon, big data will likely mean exabytes—or 1 million terabytes. All of the facts, figures, files, and records making up this data will be up for analysis, with the hope that the results will provide insight into the world we live in and will help to improve it. IEEE is a major player in this arena. The IEEE Big Data Initiative , launched in June under the Future Directions Committee— the organization’s R&D arm—is working not only to advance technologies that support and make sense of the growing mountains of data, but also to ensure that the information remains secure.

Part of the reason may be that public organizations face challenges that are greater than—or at least different from—the private sector’s hurdles when implementing these projects. First, finding the money to pay for improving IT is seldom easy and can be even more difficult for public-service groups amidst today’s budget shortfalls. Second, public institutions often run into substantial barriers when it comes to sharing data. And third, a public organization’s IT strategy can shift rather arbitrarily due to frequent leadership turnover. For a sector that’s facing new demands for transparency and performance, the benefits of analytic software powered by data warehouses are proving irresistible, especially given that recent legislation requires public institutions to better manage and track the use and effectiveness of federal funding. As public organizations adopt these technologies, they’re finding new solutions to their long-standing challenges. Data reporting regulations ring the BI bell Any discussion of data warehousing and BI in the public sector has to start with money—or too often, the lack of it. Against that backdrop, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), passed by the U.S. Congress in February 2009, promises to shower USD787 billion across the country to help promote job growth and economic activity. Twenty-nine federal agencies are tasked with distributing the funds. State and local governments will receive more than US$541 billion in discretionary and direct spending and tax cuts; of that total, USD204 billion is specifically tagged as discretionary spending, according to INPUT, a market research firm that tracks government spending. Some US$100 billion of ARRA funds is going to public schools and colleges, including US$41 billion in grants to local school districts. The Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS) in Alabama is one of them. The largest school district in the state, MCPSS has 63,000 students that generate 1.2 million attendance records and 3.5 million grade records a year. This and other data reside in three different databases (human resources, school and student information, and federal programs) in three different physical locations. Gathering the right information to create timely reports was difficult and time-consuming. For example, federal programs want test scores coupled with both student attendance and teacher qualifications, all of which were in different databases. “We were spending just incredible amounts of time building these reports, pulling the data sources together to build queries, to build analysis tools,” says David Akridge, CIO of MCPSS. “We had to pull all this together in multiple data sets, push it into an Excel spreadsheet or something like that that could be given to them,” he explains. “If they wanted to change something, we’d have to go back and rebuild it.” Akridge saw the stimulus money program as an opportunity. He convinced the board of education to revive a former attempt to build a data warehouse to help the district pull relevant information together more quickly and efficiently. The board gave its approval and, after extensive review of competitive offerings, the district hired IBM and its local business partner, DecisionEd Group, to develop a data warehouse based on IBM analytics and BI technology. By August 2009, the district had launched the new system and was rolling it out to teachers and administrators. Mobile County Public School System Project: Build a data warehouse to improve information delivery and enable more effective student management Cost: USD1.2 million Challenge: Information was in three different physical databases. Rendering reports was a time consuming, complex process that provided limited insight into student performance. School administrators had to wait for quarterly reports, which arrived too late in some cases to flag at-risk students before they got into trouble or dropped out of school. Solution: IBM Cognos Business Intelligence software (ibm.com/cognos), deployed in a relational database environment. Cognos BI produces customizable dashboards that give administrators and teachers up-to-date reports and measures, enabling them to effectively monitor each student based on a number of factors, such as attendance and grades. The system can proactively alert teachers and administrators if a confluence of these factors crosses a threshold, indicating that a student may be at risk. MCPSS is not unique. Public-sector organizations across the country, from schools to state and local governments, are using stimulus money to embrace data warehousing and BI. “Business intelligence and performance management have always been strong in the public sector, and the stimulus is just making it stronger,” says Robert Dolan, IBM global government and education industry executive, BI and performance management. “We’re seeing a lot of interest from government organizations that probably didn’t think they needed the technology. There’s a buzz around it right now.” In fact, the ARRA virtually mandates the use of BI in government by including strict requirements for accountability and transparency in the use of taxpayer dollars (see sidebar, “Stimulating intelligence”). Organizations that receive stimulus funds are required to publish accounting, allocation, and results data for the money received. The law also mandated the creation of a Web site, Recovery.gov, which is intended to provide increasingly detailed information to citizens on how stimulus funds are being used. Stimulating intelligence Four parts of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) are likely to require BI, according to Ramon C. Barquin, president of the Barquin International consultancy and co-founder of the Data Warehousing Institute. 1. Upgrade general government IT. Significant mandates require funds be used specifically to develop, enhance, or modernize IT systems throughout the federal and state government system. 2. Develop health IT systems. “Business intelligence will, of course, be one of the pillars of health IT since the massive amounts of data from electronic health records will be the prime object of significant analysis,” according to Barquin. 3. Drive education improvements. The law sets out specific goals and reforms, and requires grantees to measure and track progress toward those goals. “A boatload metrics is mandated from grantees, whether they be states, local governments, contractors, or institutions,” Barquin notes. 4. Require transparency and accountability reporting. The law requires all recipients to track how funds are used and how many jobs are created, for example. “Without a robust BI toolkit, recipients of ARRA funds will probably not be able to take full advantage of the funding and will not be able to comply with the reporting requirements,” says Barquin. Limits to sharing data But public-sector organizations face unique challenges when implementing data warehouse and BI projects. For example, when a corporation wants to share data, it usually has the option of standardizing on a certain database platform and sharing data freely among its business divisions. That’s a grand oversimplification, and the reality is usually fraught with internal politics and technical challenges, but the path to data sharing in the private sector is—at least theoretically—relatively straightforward. In the public sector, it can be a lot more complicated. Start with the fact that there may be legal restrictions on sharing data. Even state agencies that send their reports to the same person—the governor—may have different rules and legal restrictions on distributing data, says Geoff DePriest, senior manager in the performance business unit of Crowe Horwath LLP. If one agency is getting funding from the U.S. Department of Labor and another is getting funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, they may have to abide by different rules, he explains. Even without legal restrictions, effective data sharing is often thwarted because of another obstacle familiar to private-sector businesses: various agencies structure the same data differently. For example, when DePriest worked for the State of Indiana, the Department of Workforce Development architected its data on a person-by-person basis, while Family Social Services structured the data on a case-by-case basis. One agency that is trying to surmount such data-sharing challenges is the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2007, the Census Bureau granted a contract to IBM to provide data tabulation and dissemination services to support the 2010 Census and other key surveys. The Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS) division of the Census Bureau is responsible for disseminating data from five major surveys, including the decennial (10-year) census that will be conducted in 2010. But each of the five surveys collects data differently, and they use different database systems on the back end to summarize the data. “One shop may be using SAS, another produces database tables, and in some cases we simply get flat files,” says Jeff Sisson, DADS program manager. Because of this, the IT staff spends a lot of time custom-coding data for the system. With IBM’s help, DADS is building a data-loading system that will be flexible enough to handle a variety of data formats. By using standard technology and designing the system around metadata, DADS expects to increase efficiency and save back-end costs. In addition, IBM is coordinating work on American FactFinder ( www.factfinder.census.gov ), the Census Bureau Web site that publishes data for public consumption, to make it easy for the average citizen to search for and work with data on the Web site. On the current version of American FactFinder, for instance, if citizens want to see all married households in the United States, they must first specify which of the five major surveys to search. “We’re going to make a significant leap forward when we go to the new dissemination system,” says Sisson. “We’re changing the main paradigm in terms of search and navigation.” Rather than being survey-driven, the revamped site’s search function will be topic-driven. “If I want to find information on married households, I just enter that as a search term and it will bring up everything on married households, regardless of what survey the data is from. It will be a much more powerful tool for Joe Public,” adds Sisson. The system will also incorporate more sophisticated search and navigation tools, as well as enhanced mapping and charting capabilities. The goal is to accommodate a variety of users with a wide range of skill levels. The new American FactFinder Web site should be ready for the public by January 2011, says Sisson. And, by law, the data from the 2010 census has to be loaded into the system by March 31, 2011, and distributed to state governments—a challenge that the data-loading system improvements will help address. “That’s all the data that states use to reapportion their congressional districts,” he says. “We can’t be late.” U.S. Census Bureau Project: Improve data tabulation and dissemination for the 2010 Census and other key Census Bureau surveys Cost: USD89.5 million Challenge: Expedite data tabulation assessment for five major surveys of the Census Bureau, including the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey, the economic census, annual economic surveys, and the population estimates program. Increase flexibility in analysis of the data and improve the usability of the information on the American FactFinder Web site. Solution: IBM Global Business Services is integrating a variety of technologies including a pre-existing data warehouse, IBM WebSphere software, IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler, Space-Time Research software, an ESRI mapping and charting engine, and Endeca search and navigation solutions. New election, new boss Another challenge in the public sector is frequent (and practically guaranteed) leadership turnover. In state governments, for example, priorities can change with every four-year election cycle. “You can’t assume that the next round of leadership is going to want to share and leverage data in the exact same way,” notes DePriest. It happens in school districts, too. MCPSS had been trying to launch a data warehouse project for four years, says Akridge. It put out an RFP back in 2006 and IBM won that bid. Then the district got a new CIO who decided to switch to another company. That project was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Akridge was appointed CIO and saw an opportunity to try again. “We’ve been through so much with this,” he says. “We went a long time being very disappointed.” Akridge is thrilled that the project is now going so quickly. “IBM Cognos and DecisionEd have done in four weeks what other companies we’ve worked with couldn’t do in a year. Through invaluable information insights delivered by IBM technology, we’re moving closer to fulfilling our mission of graduating citizens who are prepared with the skills they need for the 21st century.” As electronic reporting requirements tighten and citizen demands for transparency and access—not to mention the number of data-gathering applications and systems—rise, warehousing, performance management, and BI technologies are likely to become central pieces of the public-sector data management puzzle. An organization may start using these technologies just to track and manage recovery funds or demonstrate compliance with government regulations, but ultimately it can use the systems to make decisions over the long term that improve productivity, reduce costs, and deliver better service.

Whereas most WFO vendors offer broad portfolios of products that focus on operational efficiency to reduce the cost of agents, Evaluagent’s narrower portfolio focuses on the people side of interaction handling, particularly agent engagement and satisfaction. The company’s founders had in-depth operational experience of contact centers, and they set out to improve the job experience for agents over what they had encountered, which included cramped working conditions, demanding performance targets, hard-to-use systems and, worst of all, customers often shouting down the phone at them.

Smaller centers typically lack budgets and technical skills to deploy and operate such systems. This situation is evident in the tools commonly used to support workforce management and analytics; smaller centers most often use spreadsheets. While spreadsheets have their place in limited ad hoc analysis for small groups, in an environment such as a contact center, they cause issues with regard to ingesting data from multiple sources and providing analysis in real time.

The term often conjures up images of little gray machines taking over tasks previously handled by humans – machines making cars, programmed vacuum cleaners and the like. In the CX space, however, we are not talking about machines but about software that can automate routine tasks. For the time being, I don’t believe robots will take over the contact center and replace human agents. Indeed our recent research into next-generation contact centers in the cloud strongly suggests the opposite. It shows that the telephone is still the top channel of communication and that almost two-thirds (62%) of organizations expect call volumes to rise over the next 24 months. Thus agents will continue to handle large volumes of interactions, which may become more complex.

Our own benchmark research into customer relationship management shows that only37 percent of organizations are able to produce analysis and reports that yield such a comprehensive view. Other research into next-generation customer analytics reveals that the main issue in this area for nearly two-thirds (63%) of organizations is data availability. To make the situation worse, customer-related data is getting ever more numerous and complex. A principal reason for this growth is the number of communication channels consumers now use to engage with organizations and the type of data these channels produce. It includes call recordings, text messages, email, social media posts, customer feedback surveys, chat scripts and event data such as videos that users download. All of these types of data are unstructured , which makes them harder for conventional analytics tools to access and analyze.

I recently wrote  that customer experience management has undergone significant change in the last 18 months, taking over the role of helping organizations become customer-centric, and that CRM vendors have played a part in these changes. Some of the larger ones have, in my view, taken a backward step by breaking CRM into three components to support marketing, sales and customer service; this makes it harder to support the end-to-end customer life cycle.

This term was followed by a statement that NGData’s products help companies transition from being “B2C to C2B,” that is, to put the customer first, an idea that has been around for several years but in my experience few companies achieve. One of the biggest challenges in this regard is that most companies are organized into business groups, and each business group typically has its own processes, systems and metrics, a situation that makes it hard to have a single view of the customer and take actions based on the same customer view, and which lends itself to focusing on internal goals, not the customer. As an example, our research into next-generation customer engagement  shows three key impediments to delivering exceptional customer experiences: systems that are not integrated (for 49% of organizations), communication channels managed as silos (47%) and customers receiving inconsistent responses at different touch points. The root cause of all these is data – customer data. Organizations have multiple systems that generate customer data, in multiple forms: for example, structured data in CRM and ERP systems, voice recordings, text data from multiple sources (letters, email, Web scripts, text messages, chat scripts and social media posts), video and event data such as a customer downloading a film. With so much data in so many formats, it is hard for companies to generate a single, “360 degree” view of the customer that can be shared across the whole organization.

Industry publications are filled with articles that deliberate, sometimes even pontificate, around whether big data is hype or reality. The good news is that the trend is toward case studies that demonstrate how leveraging big data has created significant business value . This is somewhat encouraging, but acceptance of big data still falls short, as does understanding and institutionalized concepts, facilities, tools and methodologies that we have come to expect from our \"big\" technologies. Harvey Koeppel Some people talk about big data in terms of size -- e.g., petabytes (1,024 terabytes), exabytes (1,024 petabytes) and zettabytes (1,024 exabytes). To put these terms into a context that we mere mortals can understand, an exabyte is equal to two to the 60th power (that is, 1,152,921,504,606,846,976) bytes. Still not clear? Can't imagine why. Here's a comparison that is perhaps a bit more comprehensible. If you were to stack an exabyte of regular Oreo cookies (not the Double Stuf kind) into a neat tower of pleasure, the height of the tower would be the equivalent of 19,041,819 round trips to the moon. Still unimaginable? How about 48,938 round trips to the sun? According to IDC's 2012 Digital Universe Study : In 2012, only 0.5% of the world's data was being analyzed; In 2012, 2.8 zettabytes of data will have been created and replicated; Projected growth in data is largely attributed to the worldwide proliferation of PCs, smartphones and the Internet, especially in emerging markets; and Data from machines, such as surveillance cameras and smart meters, has contributed to the doubling of the digital universe within the past two years alone. The IDC study offers the following predictions for where big data will be by 2020: The digital universe will reach 40 zettabytes, a 50-fold growth from the beginning of 2010; 40 zettabytes will be 5,247 gigabytes per person worldwide; Emerging markets will supplant the developed world as the main producer of the world's data; and The investment in spending on IT hardware, software, services, telecommunications and staff that could be considered the \"infrastructure\" of the digital universe will grow by 40%. Investment in targeted areas like storage management, security, big data and cloud computing will grow considerably faster. Whether you believe these numbers or not, there seems to be an emerging, inescapable conclusion: Size does matter. But even considering that we are living in the age of 16-plus-ounce soft drinks, 2,700-plus-foot skyscrapers, 7-plus-pound tomatoes and 8-plus-foot tall people, size alone does not seem to account for what's so big about big data. The real issue here is not about the technologies and big data. It is about the notion that these technologies -- and all of the big data that they are generating -- are also enabling and driving fundamental shifts in the way we work, play and interact with each other. According to a recent study performed by the TechAmerica Foundation, Demystifying Big Data: A Practical Guide to Transforming the Business of Government , big data is defined by \"the rapid acceleration in the expanding volume of high velocity, complex and diverse types of data.\" Here, we find reference to factors beyond size, including speed, complexity and diversity of data. The TechAmerica study tells us that 15% of the information in existence today is structured -- i.e., the traditional data fields within records within data files, and rows and columns within relational databases and spreadsheets. That means that 85% of information in existence is unstructured -- i.e., contained within social media sites, recorded conversations, videos and email. Understanding the nature and meaning of unstructured information presents significant challenges that far exceed the capabilities of typical business intelligence tools that were, for the most part, designed and built for handling the 15% that is structured. Even a casual review of any respectable business or technology publication makes it obvious that much of the expected growth in information will come from mobile devices, sensor-based devices and social media, making it likely that the 15% will shrink by comparison as the 85% grows, creating more and more diversity and complexity. But the real issue here is not about the technologies and the big data. It is rather about the notion that these technologies -- and all of the big data that they are generating -- are also enabling and driving fundamental shifts in the way we work, play and generally interact with each other. Being constantly connected almost demands real-time interaction models. It means that \"it's in the mail\" is no longer an acceptable response. I've sent you a text message and I expect an immediate response. As my 20-year-old son likes to remind me on a regular basis, \"C'mon Dad, email is for old guys.\" More from Harvey Koeppel What's next in the  history of business intelligence and analytics ? How CIOs can use the consumerization of IT  for business gain Realizing business value  from CIO and CMO partnerships Five tips to jumpstart big data's business value Business models used to be based on looking at historical data to determine what to do during the next 12 to 24 months. Business models are now based on looking at what happened during the past few minutes (or seconds) to determine what to do during the next 12 to 24 minutes (or seconds). Marketing used to be based on abstracting segments or population samples in order to predict the propensity or responsiveness of individuals within the segment to targeted products and services offered in campaigns that lasted weeks or months. Marketing is now based upon the analysis of each individual's behavioral and experiential information and providing tailored offers to that individual in real time at the point of contact -- call center, website, mobile application, and so on. Conceivably, no two individuals will ever receive the same offer, and once an individual receives an offer, that same offer may never be repeated again . This is the big deal -- it's the real \"big\" in big data. In thinking through the implications of this big data stuff and what all this means to us as IT executives and to the enterprises that we serve, a few important considerations and next steps become apparent: If you're not already, engage your leadership in conversations around what is happening and why it's important to the enterprise, to your shareholders and to your customers; Support your leadership in evolving their enterprise business strategy to adapt to and exploit these new business models and technologies and the big data capabilities that enable them; Ensure that your information and data strategies and governance processes are aligned with your business strategies and models; Manage these efforts as you would an agenda that supports innovation -- small, short-term, incremental efforts that are manageable and that yield measurable and meaningful business results; and Accept the fact that there will be failures along the way. Learn to recognize and learn from them so that the probability of success increases with subsequent iterations. If, for whatever reason, you or your enterprise remain unconvinced about big data's potential, perhaps you might want to consider the following from the recent book The Human Face of Big Data by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt : \"During the first day of a baby's life, the amount of data generated by humanity is equivalent to 70 times the information contained in the Library of Congress.\" One can't imagine how many Oreos that would be.

A Look at How Keyless SSL Works Like it? 248 comments 0 Posted March 28, 2015 Keywords : Security Secure Socket Layer, or SSL for short, is one of the key elements to providing a safe and secure web transaction. Websites that offer financial services or handle confidential user information have for long used SSL technology to encrypt such sensitive data and thus deter hackers from stealing them. Typically, SSL deployment happens with the help of a public key-private key pair . When a browser requests access to a secure page (https in most cases), it first receives a public key from the web server that is used by the browser to encrypt a random symmetric encryption key. This process is called the encryption handshake. This is then sent to the server along with other required data (which is also encrypted). Once the server receives this information, it decrypts the data using a private key and processes the information. The output is now passed on to the browser with the help of the random symmetric encryption key. This is now decrypted by the browser before being displayed to the user. The complete process of how this happens is provided in the visual below: Recently however, CloudFlare has come up with an alternate SSL technology that does not require the traditional handshaking process. In this article, we will take a look at how this technology works and compares with the traditional SSL protocol. But in case you didn't know what CloudFlare does, here is a brief : CloudFlare is a content delivery network (CDN) that protects websites from sudden traffic surges and potential DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. This is achieved through the use of their virtualized servers that are spread across the internet. Here is a video that demonstrates what they do (Courtesy : Arvixe Web Hosting ) In keyless SSL used by CloudFlare, the “handshake” operations are typically broken down into two segments. One, the public key operation, and Two, the private key operation. In order to prevent the private key from being handed over to a third party, all aspects of the private key handshaking process happens within the origin website's infrastructure. To do this, CloudFlare simply sets up a remote key server at the customer's end. This way, the private part of the handshaking process is complete within the origin web server and thus stays exclusive. So what happens now is that when a visitor approaches a secure website, the web server first sends out the public key certificate along with the random symmetric encryption key to the browser. At the same time, it passes along the information to the remote key server for signing the public key certificate along with the client and server randoms. This is responded to by the key server once the private key data has been authenticated. Once complete, CloudFlare goes ahead with the rest of the process required to output content to the user. Here is a visual representation of how the keyless SSL works So as you can see, keyless SSL does not technically do away with the public key-private key pairs. Instead it has tweaked the Transport Security Layer (TLS) process in a way that is harder to break into.

Social Collaboration Barriers in SMBs and Enterprises Like it? 240 comments 0 Posted April 19, 2015 Keywords : Social Collaboration Social collaboration tools should be the way forward in enterprises of all sizes. Email is inefficient and broken. Social networks, by comparison, are too public, but we’ve all grown familiar and comfortable with how they function. Which makes social collaboration tools a natural fit, except many companies are still struggling with implementation and adoption. A Gartner study suggests that it could be until 2015 when those buying social collaboration tools will start to see any benefit . Carol Rozwell, vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner cites how these tools are implemented as the problem: “Traditional technology rollouts, such as ERP or CRM, followed a “push” paradigm. Workers were trained on an app and were then expected to use it. In contrast, social initiatives require a “pull” approach, one that engages workers and offers them a significantly better way to work. In most cases, they can’t be forced to use social apps, they must opt-in.” The study predicts that 50 percent of large organizations will have social collaboration tools in place by 2016, and in 30 percent of these they “will be considered as essential as email and telephones are today.” Which means even in two years time 70 percent of larger organizations will not consider the tools they have essential, and a further 50 percent still won’t have these tools. One of our customers, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between ICICI Bank and Prudential plc, felt differently, which is why they reached out to us. They needed a social collaboration tool which would make it possible for different teams to function on their own, and for wider, cooperation between departments. They were facing a similar challenge to other enterprise customers. ICICI Prudential wanted to create a highly collaborative, fun online environment, with a smooth transition, mobile functionality and to get an ROI which would enable them to lay the foundation for enterprise content management. Instead of going into more detail on the topic of that particular client, which we will do in a future case study, it is worth looking at the current barriers to entry for adoption of social collaboration tools. 1. Poor Management of Resources Every system is a resource, bought in ideally for the benefit of the company. An ROI is expected from every business expense, so why do most enterprises claim to “have” a tool or platform if in fact they aren’t getting any use of it? Usually the following (incorrect) assumptions are made: We have one, so we must be using it. An off the shelf solution works for everyones job function. No training, no problem. It was sold as intuitive. Document sharing, through the likes of Google Docs, Dropbox or Box, doesn’t really count. Helpful though those services are, they aren’t fully fledged social collaboration platforms. 2. Poor Training Social networks are built on the principle of social connectivity. For any social network to work it has to have high levels of user engagement and activity, which means in an internal scenario, everyone has to be using it. If even a handful of people aren’t it is both damaging for the network and morale. Those who aren’t active online, either out of a reluctance or lack of training, will quickly feel left out of decisions and the information flow. Value is created when everyone participates, which means having both a system which is easy to use, mobile, and the training / processes in place to ensure everyone is using it. 3. Not Appreciating the True Opportunity Cost Emilie Doolittle of Tibbr, a social collaboration tool, puts the ROI clearly in this blog : “If you wanted to study access to information, for example, you would simply measure how much time it takes to locate information before and after implementation of your enterprise social network. Tie this amount of time to the dollars spent on salaries of the respective employees using this time, and voila – you now have an accurate measure of the reduction in cost your social network brings.” A Gartner study in 2012 supports her statement, which found that ‘77 percent of workers gained faster access to information via social collaboration tools (including from internal experts in the companies).’ Poor resource management, training, and not appreciating the opportunity cost are the three main reasons holding most companies back from fully adopting enterprise collaboration tools. These pitfalls are why ICICI Prudential came to us in order to avoid them and implement a system which worked for their staff. We look forward to be able to tell you in more detail how effective that was. The post Social Collaboration Barriers in SMB’s and Enterprises appeared first on Techblocks .

Cloud ROI: Business and Financial Gains Like it? 218 comments 0 Posted May 14, 2015 A significant benefit of moving resources to the cloud and cloud ROI is the resulting gains in collaboration and efficiency. Any cloud based service is fundamentally created in order to offer the user access from any location and to share information quickly and easily. Easy access to services by any staff member then encourages discussion and collaboration which leads to better decision making and a more productive workforce. Moving storage and services to the cloud results in significant productivity and business gains: Enabling mobile access. With the cloud, employees can access information from any internet-connected device, so they can pull files and data while on the road. This enables a more flexible workforce that can adapt quickly to problems and take advantage of sudden opportunities. It also can introduce cost savings by enabling work-from-home situations that reduce or even eliminate the need for expensive centralized offices. Collaboration is key. Tools that enable employees to collaborate in real time and share information help businesses to complete projects and bring new services to market more quickly. Decisions can also be aided by adding the context of members from multiple departments who can communicate through cloud-based tools regardless of geographic or other barriers. The benefits of improved collaboration can be specific to a project, or broader in terms of employee’s feeling their opinions are heard and valued. Improved processes. Various processes such as manufacturing, marketing, sales and purchasing can all be improved through collaborative cloud-based services. Sales teams can use such tools to chat about prospects, strategize in real time, and work collaboratively with product teams to offer important customer feedback. Cloud-based video conferencing and other communication tools provide users with context that simply cannot be matched via email. Immediate and downstream financial gains also come from moving services to the cloud: Zero hardware requirements. Firms that move to the cloud can enjoy reduced capital costs due to the reduction in storage and related hardware. This money can be invested in other IT projects that drive revenue. Handling scale doesn’t come with added costs. If the needs of the business grow quickly, the economies of scale of the cloud mean manageable increases in costs. Businesses with on-premises solutions are not typically equipped to double or triple capacity at a moment’s notice if needed. Companies also pay less in times of lower demand, an especially important point for firms with cyclical revenue streams. Reduced electricity bills. Cloud enablement is all offsite, so there are no expensive bills to pay to run electricity for server rooms which require consistent temperatures and costly hardware. Companies no longer need to pay rent for physical server space. Staffing needs change. IT staff are needed to manage in-house storage, but these needs are significantly reduced after moving to the cloud. Qualified IT staff are costly, and reductions in staff can free up budget for new internal projects. Shorten time to market. Companies that want to be competitive and be the first to market need to utilize every possible advantage. Cloud services enable financial gains by providing the competitive edge that comes through productive and efficient collaboration. Moving information and processes to the cloud holds the promise of both business and financial gains for companies that choose the right providers and services. Firms should be sure their staff will adopt new cloud services quickly. They should also first venture into the cloud with data or services that don’t pose a security risk if they are compromised. Companies should enlist the help of a qualified partner to help them determine the right cloud resources and platforms (such as Microsoft’s Azure) for their needs for optimal cost, efficiency, and security.   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Annie Bustos Annie Bustos is the Director of Marketing for TechBlocks - a Toronto based IT Consulting company that builds innovative applications for the web, cloud or mobile.

Leveraging K2 Business Apps for Sharepoint Like it? 223 comments 0 Posted October 6, 2015 For many businesses, there’s a familiar refrain. They know they need a large amount of data, but collecting that information and ensuring it gets into the right hands is a consistent challenge. SharePoint is often the main storage area for documents and forms, but it doesn’t contain data from various business units where information is likely siloed within other systems. The modern company needs applications that can pull data from many different sources and then integrate it into a more usable form within SharePoint. One such tool is offered by K2 ( www.k2.com ), which features a cloud-based platform called Appit that allows users to easily build apps for SharePoint. Creating applications that can effectively combine data sources requires technical expertise and investment in IT to develop, design, and maintain those apps over the longer term. K2’s platform excels at SharePoint app development for several reasons. These attributes can form a “what to look for” list when searching for a qualified third-party application vendor:   Leverage Simple Tools Involving business users in the application creation process is a recommended way to ensure the applications perform meaningful actions. Vendors such as K2 offer easy-to-use tools that are accessible to both technical and non-technical users. The platform should also be sophisticated enough to avoid “reinventing the wheel”, for example as connections to lines of business systems are built for one app or form, this setup can be duplicated for other solutions. Integration Across Multiple Lines of Business Building and maintaining apps should not be solely an IT task. Therefore, you need a flexible platform that can work with SharePoint to allow users to build their own apps, forms, and workflows. Non-technical users should be able to create such content from multiple sites and libraries and by pulling in data from other lines of business. Enable “Super Users” As SharePoint adoption grows, there are more “super users” that do not have a deep technical background but can still build business apps for SharePoint. A platform that sets free such users is desirable as it can free IT resources, but there still needs to be some control measures in place. Security (as Always) is Critical An app that brings uniformity and cost savings is worthless without strong security. The app platform should allow a business to maintain existing security protocols without restricting access to needed data. Beware of third-party solutions that are storing sensitive data within apps. While the app might be password protected, the data and the login credentials are both stored within the app, which creates a significant security risk. Instead, chose a solution that offers connections to your line of business systems from the app, so you can rely on your current security measures and restrict user’s data access. Interfaces for Any Device Adoption of a new SharePoint application will only grow if it features an easy-to-use interface. Work with a vendor that makes interfaces which can work seamlessly on any device. Advanced SharePoint app platforms such as K2 enable companies to manage their short-term needs such as improving workflows and documents, as well as build apps that go across multiple systems. Choosing such a platform will result in long-term money savings and more flexibility as the business changes over time.

How Microsoft SharePoint Can Transform Your Business Like it? 188 comments 0 Posted November 12, 2015 Launched by Microsoft in 2001, the SharePoint platform has become a “jack of all trades” type of platform that includes a wide range of business functions that can transform an antiquated business into a model of collaboration, speed and efficiency. So what is SharePoint all about? It’s fundamentally an enterprise content management system  built to enhance business collaboration, one that encourages a more streamlined way of sharing information and getting tasks done efficiently. It combines enterprise-level social networking with document management , workflow management, cloud storage , enterprise search, and Business Intelligence , all working together harmoniously. All of these features can give a company a distinct competitive advantage as they are able to develop well-informed products or services, collaborate and share informatio on the go and can operate nimbly to adapt to changing market conditions. And SharePoint is eminently customizable with a host of different features and an integrated app store, so it can be tailored to fit your specific business needs. Benefits of Microsoft SharePoint include: 1. Content management. SharePoint offers cloud-based access to documents, with check-in and check-out notifications. Users can have access to needed files whether they are on mobile devices or their desktop. Productivity can be greatly improved when staff members can grab the right information in a timely manner. 2. Real-time editing. Working with multiple authors is simple with SharePoint. Users can see which paragraphs others are working on, and turn on versioning to establish a return point in case new edits are not accepted or wanted. An approval tag can also be implemented, so a document cannot be shared until approval is designated. 3. Create custom workflows. SharePoint allows users and managers to create workflows that designate the path of certain processes and/or documents. For example, something as common as requesting office supplies can be streamlined with a SharePoint workflow. 4. Find what you need easily. Powerful search functions allow users to search through vast amounts of company data to find the document or data that is vital for their job. Better search means less time wasted asking others for documents, and more time working. 5. Get social. The core case for SharePoint is to improve collaboration both among employees and outside groups. Every SharePoint users has customized information about them, including links to social networking sites and data about the individual user. “Community Sites” can be setup to encourage groups of staff members to discuss certain company topics or problems – encouraging group thinking and collaboration. 6. Scalability & apps integration. SharePoint's cloud based infrastructure easily allows administrators to add or remove features.  Its app store, connects users to a variety of applications such as Yammer for chat, e-signature applications, and enhanced extranet searches. 7. It’s easy to use. Any large-scale platform absolutely has to be simple to operate, otherwise adoption will suffer. SharePoint is continually refined with user friendliness in mind. Tasks are streamlined, the UI is adjusted for clarity, and user feedback is reviewed to make refinements.   With the launch of SharePoint 2013 , Microsoft has distribution of the platform tied with the Office 356 suite, which means important updates occur automatically. Users or IT professionals no longer need to perform manual updates, and can be assured they stay up to date on the latest security or performance issues. The benefits of Microsoft SharePoint outlined above make it suitable for a wide variety of office environments no matter what the size, but is especially powerful for larger companies that have to manage a large volume of documentation and have many remote or “in-the-field” workers. As a Microsoft partner, TechBlocks is well versed in the SharePoint platform and has helped many businesses to deploy, integrate and customize it's features so they can realize it's full potential.

How to Get Management to Pay Attention to Your Research Results Like it? 300 comments 0 Posted August 8, 2014 Keywords : research , results We’ve all been there. You’ve written a grand survey, conducted an amazing series of focus groups, pulled all the data together into a fabulous report, and now management won’t give you the time of day. The solution is simple. Well, perhaps not that simple, but certainly worthwhile. Much of the time, it comes down to making it easy and that’s what we’re going to do here. 1)  Choose one key point.  Research reports are often filled to the brim with fascinating datapoints and a number of interesting insights. But no one other than you has the time to give all of this data the thorough review it deserves. However, YOU know which key point will have the largest impact on the business – increase sales the most, increase customer satisfaction the most, reduce churn the most. 2)  Provide the solution.  You found the key point which means you probably also know the solution. Take the initiative to think through all the possible solutions. Which ones would cost more or less? Which ones would require a smaller or greater headcount? Which ones would take more or less time? Identify the two or three best possible solutions and layout out their key points. 3)  Provide the action.  Figure out how you personally can follow through on the solution. Can you identify the key players? Who would be the best project lead? Are YOU the best project lead? What key players are missing and need to be identified? What resources need to be set aside? 4)  Ask for 15 minutes of their time.  Instead of a full hour or half hour, ask for just 15 minutes. Even the busiest of managers can find 15 minutes to carefully think about something. At this point, now that you’ve laid out exactly what needs to happen, you really don’t need to ask for an hour. You’ve already done all the pre-work and the management team only needs to confirm that they are satisfied with your pre-work.  Of course, you may have done such a great job with all of your pre-work that they  do  want to spend an hour with you. Wouldn’t that be grand! Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Annie Pettit I am the Chief Research Officer at Peanut Labs, and VP, Research Standards at Research Now.

Does Your Research Company Look Like a Scam? Like it? 121 comments 0 Posted September 11, 2014 Keywords : research company , survey here are hundreds, possibly thousands, of companies out there looking for people to answer surveys. Some of these companies are legitimate marketing research companies that truly want to hear opinions from people. Other companies are less than upfront and may  be more interested in marketing to people or selling products. But how do people know which is which? In our survey, we asked people how they know whether a survey company is legitimate. Here are some of their thoughts. “Do a search online to see if it has been reported as a scam.” “Usually surveys aren’t scams. But offers like Entry For Sweepstakes Earn 1,500! are scams mostly.” “Friends Share it on Facebook or Twitter” “I check out all of their terms and conditions, see if they are accepted by the BBB, also read their policys, try to find comments about them from other people” “I only participate in surveys sponsored by companies that I trust” “If they’ve been in business for a long time and are still in operation-usually a good sign.” We followed up by asking people to choose from a list of 10 specific ways that they know a survey company is legitimate. The top five reasons included: Credit card information is not required 53% They don’t have to pay to join 51% They aren’t asked to download something 44% The website doesn’t open a bunch of extra web screens 32% Tie for 27% between 1) Trust the originating website and 2) When I get the first incentive Why do you need my credit card information? Fortunately, legitimate marketing research companies  pass all of these tests. They don’t need credit card information and they don’t ask people to pay to share their opinions. However, things are a bit tricky when it comes to downloads. Though legitimate companies generally don’t ask people to download software to participate in surveys, they may offer a mobile phone app which does require a download. Companies should ensure that their panel members are not required to download mobile apps until the panelists have had sufficient time to get to know and trust the company. Another tricky area concerns companies that research internet behaviors. Usually, this entails downloading software that will keep track of the websites people visit. Legitimate companies will always ask permission first but, again, people should be given the time to get to know and trust a company before being asked to divulge such personal information. Why are you asking me to buy something? Lastly, some people express concerns that scam companies try to get them to buy something. Fortunately, legitimate survey companies never do this. They may ask  IF you would buy  something or  HAVE you bought  something or when you  PLAN to buy  something as they truly are interested to know what you have done and plan to do. But they will never follow up by asking for a purchase now. To help people in this regard, survey companies should consider revising their purchase questions to assure people that they are not being asked to buy something. In the end, it comes down to transparency.  We need to tell people who take surveys how we work and what we are doing. Honesty is always the best policy.

What Does the Regression Model Indicate? Like it? 255 comments 0 Posted September 15, 2014 Keywords : data interpretation I just returned from two of the best marketing research conferences out there, ESOMAR and WAPOR, and was flipping through the notebook of rants and raves that I create as I listen to speakers. Interestingly, even at these conferences, where the best of the best speak, I heard a certain phrase repeatedly. “ The regression model indicated…” “The data indicated…” “The results indicated…” Well you know what? The data indicated absolutely nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Data is data. Numbers in a table. Points in a chart. Pretty diagrams and statistical output. The only thing that indicated anything is you. YOU looked at the data and the statistical output and interpreted it based on your limited or extensive skills, knowledge, and experience. If I were to review your data, My skills, knowledge, and experience might say that it indicates something completely different. Data are objective and indicate nothing. Take responsibility for your own interpretations.

Missing Data: Whose Problem Is It Anyways? Like it? 276 comments 0 Posted October 15, 2014 Keywords : Data Management Every statistics package is designed with fancy little features to help you deal with missing data. You can choose to “Exclude cases listwise” or “Exclude cases pairwise.” And if you’re a particularly skilled researcher, you can apply some complicated statistical procedures to impute your missing cases based on the existing data from other people. But of course, the preferable solution is to not have any missing data at all. You see, in the age of paper and pencil surveys, SPSS and other software programs had to make allowances for missing data because people could run through a ten page survey and choose not to answer one or more questions. It was really painful, and it still is really painful, to throw away ten pages of survey answers when just a few responses are missing here and there. Nowadays, however, the pen and paper survey has nearly gone the way of the dodo bird. Online surveys are the prime method of obtaining survey completes due to many advantages. Not only is it easier to gather opinions from thousands of people around the globe overnight, the online methodology incorporates many highly desirable techniques for mid-survey data validation. One of those techniques is the ability to prevent a person from going on to the next question until every question prior has been completed. And that brings me to my premise. Who’s problem is missing data anyways? In the most benign of responses, missing data is a technical problem that is easily fixed by checking the “Required” option next to a question. If that ‘Required’ box wasn’t mistakenly left unchecked, you could also say it is the researcher’s problem, an annoying problem that they now have to deal with statistically. I think it’s neither. Missing data is the manifestation of a researcher realizing that their survey writing skills are not perfect and that responders need a way to express themselves during those imperfections. You see, even the simplest of questions doesn’t a have a perfect solution. Let’s consider the basic gender question. Are you: Male Female For most people, that’s an easy question. I’m female so I check the female option. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. People who are transgendered or genderqueer or gender non-conforming (Yes, those are all real options), might not know how to answer that question. In fact, a  very detailed 68-page paper describes a research project  carried out to determine what is the best gender question. We could force people to answer the gender question and ensure that there are no-missing data – and ensure that some of the answers are wrong.  Or, we could allow people to skip the gender question and ensure that there are no wrong data – although there would be some missing data. Let me put it like this. Survey data are not simply data, and missing data is not simply missing ones and zeros. There are people on the other end of the electrical current sharing their opinions with us, people who want to share accurate data, people who want to treated nicely. The next time you want to force an answer to a question to prevent missing data, please consider this: Have you included all possible answer options such that everyone who answers the question will not feel like they are lying by choosing an option? Do you truly need absolutely every single person to answer this question or the survey results will be null and void?

Stop Asking for Margin of Error in Polling Research Like it? 326 comments 0 Posted February 1, 2015 Keywords : polling Just a few days ago, I moderated a  webinar  with four leading researchers and statisticians to discuss the use of margin of error with non- probability  samples. To a lot of people, that sounds like a pretty boring topic. Really, who wants to listen to 45 minutes of people arguing about the appropriateness of a statistic? Who, you ask? Well, more than 600 marketing researchers, social researchers, and pollsters registered for that webinar. That’s as many people who would attend a large conference about far more exciting things like using Oculus Rift and the Apple Watch for marketing research purposes. What this tells me is that there is a lot of quiet grumbling going on. I didn’t realize how contentious the issue was until I started looking for panelists. My goal was to include 4 or 5 very senior level statisticians with extensive experience using margin of error on either the academic or business side. As I approached great candidate after great candidate, a theme quickly arose among those who weren’t already booked for the same time-slot – the issue was too contentious to discuss in such a public forum. Clearly, this was a topic that had to be brought out into the open. The margin of error was designed to be used when generalizing results from probability samples to the population. The point of contention is that a large proportion of marketing research, and even polling research, is not conducted with probability samples. Probability samples are theoretical – it is generally impossible to create a sampling frame that includes every single member of a population and it is impossible to force every randomly selected person to participate. Beyond that, the volume of non- sampling errors  that are guaranteed to enter the process, from poorly designed questions to overly lengthy complicated surveys to poorly trained interviewers, mean that non-sampling errors could have an even greater negative impact than sampling errors do. Any reasonably competent statistician can calculate the margin of error with numerous decimal places and attach it to any study. But that doesn’t make it right. That doesn’t make the study more valid. That doesn’t eliminate the potentially misleading effects of  leading questions  and skip logic errors. The margin of error, a single number, has erroneously come to embody the entire system and processes related to the quality of a study. Which it cannot do. In spite of these issues, the media continue to demand that  Margin of Error  be reported. Even when it’s inappropriate and even when it’s insufficient. So to the media, I make this simple request. Stop insisting that polling and marketing research results include the margin of error. Sometimes, the best measure of the quality of research is how transparent your vendor is when they describe their research methodology, and the strengths and weaknesses associated with it.   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Annie Pettit I am the Chief Research Officer at Peanut Labs, and VP, Research Standards at Research Now.

Why We Need More Big Data Doctors Like it? 380 comments 0 Posted August 25, 2015 Keywords : The Big Data Guru Doctors are highly educated and (usually) very good at certain things – examining and talking to patients, and using the data they extract to diagnose and treat illness. What they are not necessarily so good at, is what they do with that data afterwards. But increasingly, innovations in health care involving big data are producing solutions which are helping physicians to diagnose more accurately and treat more effectively. If you’re older than about 35, you might remember the first time you saw a computer in a doctor’s surgery. Now they are commonplace, and it is not unusual to see your physician accessing information to help with diagnosing and prescribing medicine, during a consultation. Electronic Health Records have been around for a while – various systems of differing reliability , designed to make patient data more readily accessible, as well as transferable between the different healthcare professionals or institutions which may be involved in a patient’s care. But with the big data revolution, innovators are coming up with increasingly sophisticated methods of incorporating that information with data from hundreds of other health-related sources. The aim is to make the most relevant and up-to-date information available to doctors, in real-time as they consult with their patients. Now companies such as Apixio and Allscripts provide systems which not only give the doctor a complete overview of a patient’s medical history, but provide data which can be used on a larger scale – for example to highlight correlations between different medical conditions which may not have been noticed before, and give insights into how these may be affected by other factors, such as the methods used to treat the conditions, or the part of the world in which they occur. In turn, this aggregated data can be reapplied to the individual patient – meaning their treatment will be backed by statistical insights gleaned from worldwide health surveys, data on the general population and the latest news from recently published medical papers and journals. This will also help hospitals and front-line healthcare providers prepare for increasing demand on their services due to epidemics and seasonal outbreaks. Overall, this trend is in-line with a general movement which has been taking place in healthcare over the last 20 years, away from “treating the sick” towards “keeping the population healthy”. In time, this will lead to far more emphasis on preventative care – doctors will be able to predict which of their patients are most likely to develop serious (and expensive to treat) health issues such as diabetes and heart disease at a far earlier stage in their life, and work with them towards minimizing risks. As well as front-line services, the pharmaceutical industry is embracing big data in a big way, hoping that by vastly increasing the volume of data shared from clinical trials, the process of developing and distributing new drugs will become more efficient. As always there are dangers – will the role of the doctor become less relevant – reduced to ticking boxes before a computer does the real work of diagnosing the illness and prescribing the remedy? And with the sort of predictive treatment I mentioned above, is there a risk that it may lead to treatment being refused or withdrawn if a patient does not comply with the prescribed preventative measures (i.e eating more healthily and taking more exercise, to reduce the risk of heart disease). When you take into account the upcoming boom in “wearables” which can measure activity levels (and, theoretically at this point, but in the future who know?) report them directly to your doctor (or medical insurer). These are probably questions that society will have to answer in the future. But in the meantime, we can be hopeful that the enthusiasm the medical and pharmaceutical industries are showing towards moving into more data-driven practices will lead to better treatment, at lower cost.

Thanks for sharing the information.  In my opinion, if data mistakes in business or marketing, sometimes, it can be forgivable or correctable. You just have to fix it with huge budgets and process reorganizations. However, when it comes to public health and life, who or what will take the responsiblity for what data used to treat for cancer?  Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Please note: Your first comment as a registered user will be held for moderation up to 24 hours (usually less).

Zynga: A Big Data Company Masquerading as a Gaming Company Like it? 641 comments 0 Posted April 5, 2013 Keywords : data in the cloud , gaming development , Hadoop , metrics , Zynga , Decision Management , Best Practices , SQL , Cloud Computing , Big Data , IT , Business Intelligence , Data Management , Inside Companies How much data does an online game developer like Zynga create and use on a daily basis? The answer is, not surprisingly, a lot. They operate at such a large scale that on a regular day Zynga delivers one petabyte of content. In order to cope with these extreme high demands of data, they have built a flexible cloud server centre that can easily add up to 1,000 servers in just 24 hours. In fact, Zynga’s private and public cloud server park is known as one of the biggest hybrid clouds. Zynga is built on top of major platforms such as Facebook, Google+ or Android/iOS, and offers its own Zynga API. Data at Zynga is divided among two types: Game data, which is Vertica driven and generates approximately 60 billion rows of data and 10 terabyte of semi-structured data on a daily basis. Server data, generating over 13 terabyte of raw log data from the server and app logs. This data is stored in Vertica or Hadoop. Interestingly, Zynga’s database keeps growing as they never delete the data because of the complex process this requires. Zynga has released an infographic that gives more insight in their big data usage: So, big data is truly big at Zynga, but how do they cope with it? Metrics driven culture At Zynga everything resolves around metrics and for the management at Zynga, metrics are a discipline. There is a strong desire at the management to track goal progress by metrics and to support this there is an open ad-hoc SQL access, reports are freely accessible by everyone and integrating external services is easy. Brian Reynolds   explains that at Zynga the designers are separated from those analysing the metrics. Analysts need to figure out what questions should be asked and the designers will develop/adjust the game around the answer. A great example of this data drive decision-making is that they pivoted the use of animals in Farmville 2.0. In the original version of Farmville, animals were merely decoration. However, data showed that more and more people started interacting with the animals and even use real money to buy additional virtual animals. So, in Farmville 2.0 animals were made much more central. Due to this metrics driven culture, Zynga combines art with science: Art is related to creating, developing and implementing an idea into a game. With the science behind it they listen to customers and find out whether the game is fun or not. Subsequently, they can adjust and pivot games if necessary. The scalable service architecture Zynga operates a large number of different databases for different tasks. For example, they use Splunk in order to store primary log analytics. They have 70 nodes and 650 million of rows of data on a daily basis that is stored in a streaming event database using a MySQL cluster. They have sharded transactional databases and they use a Vertica Data Warehouse. The statistics that Zynga generates are gigantic as well. They have over 6.000 different report types and 15.000 ad hoc queries from users on a daily basis. Each day they run 3.000 reports. Analysts, product managers, engineers and business intelligence teams use all these insights to optimize and improve the operations and products. All together, Zynga is a truly big data player and uses big data to create engaging social games that people enjoy and play with friends. Copyright Big Data Startups 2013.

Big Data Will Revolutionize Learning Like it? 411 comments 0 Posted April 30, 2013 Keywords : Analytics , coursera , education , MOOC , Big Data , Data Management New technologies allow schools, colleges and universities to analyse absolutely everything that happens. From student behaviour, testing results, careers developments of students as well as educational needs based on changing societies. A lot of these data has already been stored and is used for statistical analysis by government agencies such as the National Center for Educational Statistics . With the rise of more and more online education and the development of MOOC’s all the data gets a completely new meaning. Big data allow for very exciting changes in the educational field that will revolutionize the way students learn and teachers teach. To stimulate this trend, the US Department of Education (DOE) was part of a host of agencies to share a $200 million initiative to begin applying big data analytics to their respective functions, as described in a post by James Locus. Improve student results The overall goal of big data within the educational system should be to improve student results. Better students are good for society, organisations as well educational institutions. Currently, the answers to assignments and exams are the only measurements on the performance of students. During his or her student life however, every student generates a unique data trail. This data trail can be analysed in real-time to deliver an optimal learning environment for the student as well to gain a better understanding in the individual behaviour of the students. It is possible to monitor every action of the students. How long they take to answer a question, which sources they use, which questions they skipped, how much research was done, what the relation is to other questions answered, which tips work best for which student, etc. Answers to questions can be checked instantly and automatically (except for essays perhaps) give instant feedback to students. In addition, big data can help to create groups of students that prosper due to the selection of who is in a group. Students often work in groups where the students are not complimentary to each other. With algorithms it will be possible to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each individual student based on the way a student learned online, how and which questions were answered, the social profile etc. This will create stronger groups that will allow students to have a steeper learning curve and deliver better group results. Create mass-customized programs All this data will help to create a customized program for each individual student. Big data allows for customization at colleges and universities, even if they have 10.000s of students. This will be created with blended learning ; a combination of online and offline learning. It will give students the opportunity to develop their own personalized program, following those classes that they are interested in, working at their own pace, while having the possibility for (offline) guidance by professors. Providing mass customization in education is a challenge, but thanks to algorithms it becomes possible to track and assess each individual student. We already see this happening in the MOOC’s that are developed around the world now. When Andrew Ng taught the Machine Learning class at Stanford University, generally 400 students participated. When it was developed as a MOOC at Coursera in 2011, it attracted 100.000 students. Normally this would take Andrew Ng 250 years to teach the same amount of students. 100.000 students participating in a class generate a lot of data that will deliver insights. Being able to cater for 100.000 students at once, also requires the right tools to be able to process, store, analyse and visualize all data involved in the course. At the moment, these MOOC’s are still mass made, but in the future they can be mass customized. With 100.000 students participating in a MOOC, it will give universities the possibility to find the absolute best students from all over the world. Based on the individual behaviour of the students, their grades, their social profile and their networking skills algorithms can find the best students. These students can then receive a scholarship that will increase the overall level of the university. Improve the learning experience in real-time When students start working on their own, in their customized blended learning program, the vast amount of teaching, which most of the time is covered by general topics that have to appeal to all students from different levels, can be done online and by themselves. The professor can monitor all students in real-time and start a much more interesting and deeper conversation on the topic of choice. This will give students the possibility to gain a better understanding of the topics. When students are monitored in real-time, it can help to improve the digital textbooks and course outlines that are used by the students. Algorithms can monitor how the students read the texts. Which parts are difficult to understand, which parts are easy and which parts are unclear. Based on how often a text is read, how long it takes to read a text, how many questions are asked around that topic, how many links are clicked for more information etc. If this information is provided in real-time, authors can change their textbooks to meet the needs of the students thereby improving the overall results. Even more, big data can give insights in how each student learns at an individualized level. Each student learns differently and the way a student learns affects the final grade of course. Some students learn very efficiently while other may be extremely inefficient. When the course materials are available online, it can be monitored how a student learns. This information can be used to provide a customized program to the student or provide real-time feedback to become more efficient in learning and thus improve their results. Reduce dropouts, increase results All these analyses will improve the student results and perhaps also reduce dropout rates at universities or colleges. Dropouts are expensive for educational institutes as well as for society. When students are closely monitored, receive instant feedback and are coached based on their personal needs, it can help to reduce dropout rates as mentioned as well in a post by Hortonworks. Using predictive analytics on all the data that is collected can give educational institute insights in future student outcomes. These predictions can be used to change a program if it predicts bad results on a particular program or even run scenario analysis on a program before it is started. Universities and colleges will become more efficient in developing a program that will increase results thereby minimizing trial-and-error. After graduation, students can still be monitored to see how they are doing in the job market. When this information is made public, it will help future students in their decision when choosing the right university. Big data will revolutionize the learning industry in the coming years. More and more universities and colleges are already turning to big data to improve overall student results. Smarter students who study faster will have a positive effect on organisations and society.

How The Internet of Things Will Create a Smart World [INFOGRAPHIC] Like it? 593 comments 0 Posted August 22, 2013 Keywords : infographics , smart world , the internet of things The  Internet of Things is an important trend within big data. Within a few years we will have to talk in Brontobytes when we discuss data coming from sensors in the smart world of the future. The Internet of Things refers to objects that can be uniquely identified via an IP-address and all of them are connected to the Internet. Objects (which can be anything from a car, to a chair or a bottle of soda) that are equipped with identifiers can be managed and inventoried by computers and algorithms. These objects contain sensors and the data theses sensors collect are shared with an Internet-like structure. All those devices connected to the internet will create a smart world that will change the way societies work. Libelium created market research document with  50 Sensor Applications for a Smarter World  and they compiled all those sensor applications into one infographic:       Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Mark van Rijmenam Mark van Rijmenam is Co-founder and CEO of Datafloq.

They pertain to \"objects that can be uniquely identified\"   First, what makes the \"internet of things\" \"doable\" is the fact that objects can be \"tagged\" (preferably forever or for just their life span with the same IP-address) ...much like the family of sea lions I was observing on a dock last weekend. They were individually \"tagged\" so their \"behavior\" can be remotely monitored. However, I wondered if the separate tags were logically connected to each other so that not just the sea lion but the whole family (pod or whatever they are called) can be collectively tracked. This brings up the second thought.   Second, it would seem that the connections among \"objects\" are one goal of the \"internet of things.\" But those connections can run in multiple directions. On one hand, we have the relationship that the tagged object has to the collection of tagged objects making up, say, the power plant (or in the case of the sea lion, say, its injured flipper) and on the other hand, we have the relationship that the tagged object has to the other objects that make it up, say the rivets, and even the raw materials. We need to resolve, at what point do we start and stop tagging \"objects\" and defining what is an object to start with? This brings up the third point.   Third, the first and second points have been problematic with persons, organizations and groups. We seem challenged with coming up with a single unique identifier so that we can connect every \"nest\" of data about a person, organization or group scattered about the planet and relate it to a single \"object.\" At first it would seem that \"things\" may be simpler to \"uniquely identify\" but on second thought after viewing the infographic it may be just as complex.     Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Please note: Your first comment as a registered user will be held for moderation up to 24 hours (usually less).

How the Next Generation of Databases Could Solve Your Problems Like it? 645 comments 0 Posted October 20, 2013 Keywords : Databases , Big Data The past decades organisations have been working with relational databases to store their structured data. In the big data era however, these types of databases are not sufficient anymore. Although they made a huge difference in the database world and unlocked data for many applications, relational databases miss some important characteristics for the big data era. NoSQL databases are the answer that solves many of these problems. It is a completely new way of thinking about databases. Although NoSQL was first mentioned in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi who used it to name his lightweight, open-source relational database that did not expose the standard SQL interface, it really became know in 2009. Since then the NoSQL movement has been growing rapidly and not surprisingly as these databases have some important benefits; they are schema less, fast, agile and they can work with non-relational distributed and unstructured data. The type of data your organisation nowadays typically collects. Scalability, agility and flexibility are often noted as the most important features of NoSQL databases. Although it has not yet reached the hype of Hadoop, thanks to these features the NoSQL movement draws a lot of attention. There are different types of NoSQL databases and each focuses on different applications: Document database; Graph store; Key-value stores; Wide-column stores. The amount of available NoSQL databases is growing rapidly and currently there are, as this website shows, over 150 of them. On of the more well known is MarkLogic and recently they announced MarkLogic 7, an Enterprise NoSQL that shows the vast possibilities of NoSQL databases for organisations. On October 15 they organised their European Summit, where they explained more about the possibilities. The Enterprise NoSQL is a document-centric database that structures the data in a tree-structure. Every entity is a document that can have a different tree structure and these tree-structures can support any-structured data ranging from full-text data to geospatial data and anything in between. The Enterprise NoSQL indexes what it sees meaning it is capable of indexing words, phrases, stemmed words and phrases (meaning linguistic capabilities), the structure of the document, values and collections (how the data is organised) as well as security permissions (which role has access to what data). All this data is injected schema-less into the database and immediately made available for search. Their latest product has some new features that show the vast possibilities of todays NoSQL databases and for the first time moves into the direction of semantics. They have included several indexes that can be seen as a built-in in-memory column store which can be used for very fast analytics. These include among others a range index (to perform queries based on data range, even if no range is included in the data), a geospatial index (to perform location based queries) and a Triple Index, which offers the capability to store and search semantic triples. These so called ‘semantic triples’ are an important feature of the next generation databases and a pre-requisite for the semantic web. They are a way to represent information. This can be anything from the value of an item in a spreadsheet to the name of a person in a sentence.  Semantic triples enable relationships between pieces of data and are related more closely to the way humans think. If you combine them with Linked Open Data (facts that are freely available and in a form that is easily consumed by machines) or information from DBPedia (Wikipedia but in a structured format understandable by machines), these triples suddenly receive a meaning and give data the context required to be valuable in a semantic environment. As the founder of MarkLogic, Christopher Lindblad, explained during the summit: “Data is not information, what you have to do to get from data to information is add context.” We humans add that context automatically and subconsciously, based on what we have learned in our lives. Computers cannot do that and they need context coming from different sources such as DBPedia. In a semantic environment this is a lot easier to achieve and the information becomes easier to find and a lot more valuable. A great example of this is the Knowledge Graph of Google, which was introduced in May 2012 and which I discussed earlier. Semantic search allows you to perform a combination of queries ranging from text queries, document queries, range queries or pose a query that goes over multiple data sources. It can return results that might not even contain the exact term you used in a query, but which is very closely linked to what you are looking for and therefore still relevant.  It is a new way to find what you are looking for and in combination with Enterprise NoSQL the new way to understand and find corporate data. During the summit quite a few examples where shown that showed the vast possibilities of this combination. First of all the BBC, they used MarkLogic during the Olympics and since a year they have also started to use the Enterprise NoSQL server for the iPlayer . The on-demand iPlayer is a service that has thousands of different programs available for viewers on almost any device, ranging from smartphone, tablet to desktop. All sorts of related data around the television shows are added to a search and that offers users of the iPlayer a very rich experience. The BBC created many different triples for their shows thereby being able to provide a lot of additional relevant information to the customers. The same thing they do for their websites, where they can automatically build a webpage based on a news story. For example a story about a football player gets automatically and within milliseconds enriched with information about the club the player plays, information about recent matches as well as a league table. These semantic and dynamic publishing pages offer a lot of value to the users. Another example is Newz , a Dutch publishing application developed by Dayon in corporation with 12 competitive newspapers in The Netherlands. Newz offers new startup companies the possibility to use the Newz tool to create new business models that focuses on using articles from the newspapers and thereby creating tailored services for a certain segment. Newz derives additional information from articles based on semantic technology. They specify different meta data from the article and based on the context in the article information is added (triples). This additional information enriches the article. As a result the additional context can also be used to find the right article for the right customer, delivering a tailored experience to the customer. Without the semantic technology, this would not have been possible. Finally there was the example of how The Church of Latter-Day Saints ( LDS ) applies big data to deliver content to its 15 million followers. Mike Bower , Principal Architect for the LDS, explained that they have over 600 websites in more than 100 languages that cover over 18500 published documents. They process millions of transactions per day and they used the Enterprise NoSQL server to make all that information searchable and available for all its followers. In addition, they have created The Gospel Topic Explorer , which is also powered by MarkLogic and takes full advantage of the semantic triples discussed here. They use semantics to add relationships in the information available in order to improve search results. It includes over 6600 different connected topics, 23000 relationships and 67000 facts that can be explored to discover how they relate. Today’s world is changing rapidly and new tools are being developed constantly that take full benefit of the new data opportunities and that are capable of dealing with vast amounts of unstructured data. One of these tools is (Enterprise) NoSQL database in combination with semantic search, which is a great way forward. These type of technologies can really help your organisation in building mission critical applications that make a difference and put your organisation ahead of the pack.

It is pretty well-known at this point that NoSQL does not mean \"no SQL\". It stands for \"not only SQL\".

If I Text You Tonight, Will Your Analytics Text Me Back in the Morning? Like it? 147 comments 0 Posted August 13, 2015 It’s a classic scenario. Two people meet at a party. They chat and then exchange information. However, they never speak or meet again. It is as though the contact information was never exchanged. So, what happened? Was there never intent to follow up? Or, did the information get lost, forgotten, or placed in a pile that never got acted upon? There is a similar scenario I see play out often when it comes to text analytics. Most text analytics are focused on analyzing text right now for immediate tactical insights. Then, the text is virtually forgotten, if not literally deleted. Think about it. Sentiment analysis is a summary of general attitudes right now. Customer service organizations track feedback to identify emerging product problems. Marketing managers look at customer feedback to identify if a promotion is getting the hoped-for attention. Whether social media, email, online chat, or transcribed phone calls, text is being used more and more frequently today. While the previously mentioned analytics absolutely provide value and are worth pursuing, there are additional opportunities that should not be missed. By throwing this information away after the initial analysis is completed, you may be missing opportunities to impact the business in very creative ways. LET TEXT BE STRATEGIC AS WELL AS TACTICAL By all means, your organization should continue to pursue tactical text analytics that look at things like sentiment and customer service trends right now. However, don’t fail to think about the more strategic, longer term value that the information in text can provide. Just like throwing away that contact information from the party could cause you to miss out on a potential spouse, so can throwing away text after using it for immediate purposes cause you to miss out on big future opportunities. We’ll begin with a simple example. Let’s say I mention on social media that I love to grill Rib Eye steak. Since my favorite foods do not change very often, this could be added to my customer profile. Then, when Rib Eye steak goes on sale at my local grocery store in the future, wouldn’t it make sense to let me know about it? In another case, I might complain to a call center that my new car rides a little rougher than I’d like. By making that fact part of my customer profile, the manufacturer will know to emphasize the smooth ride when marketing my next car to me and making sure that the car does have a smoother ride than my first one. We could go through many more examples, but the point is that people often reveal important information in the text that they generate. Simply using those comments for tactical analysis today leaves a lot of value on the table. By looking for comments that reveal various preferences or traits, we can expand our knowledge of, and relationship with, customers. TEXT ME, MAYBE? The action you should take is to consider how customer profiles can be enhanced with new data points derived from text analytics. This information can become a long term, if not permanent, part of each customer’s profile. Many of the data points might not be relevant very often, but when they are relevant, they can be incredibly relevant. Don’t look as text as only an opportunity for a one-time look into a customer’s attitude today. Also view text as a way to get to know your customers and to gather important information on them over time. At some point in the future, you just may want to text them back and they might love to hear from you in a way that acknowledges that you understood what they said to you!

We are reaching an inflection point in the market where the level of hype and frequent confusion about “Big Data” will soon be replaced by customer success stories. Already we’re seeing such stories emerge as businesses willingly share their triumphs. As with any paradigm shift in computing where a particular topic draws great attention from the press, investors and innovators, this shift is supported by strong business value proof points. This was the case during the paradigm shifts and hype cycles of client server, distributed computing, the internet as well as service oriented architectures and languages, such as Java.  We’re also seeing the emergence of a beneficial ecosystem that quickly compliments or extends the capabilities of the core enabling technology; in this case, technologies that compliment big data systems such as Hadoop, Cassandra, Accumulo and solutions from industry data titans Oracle and IBM. So what trends might we see emerge in the Big Data ecosystem? Continuous Expansion and Unification Of SQL On Hadoop . A number of technology companies are working hard to build a layer of technology on non-SQL enabled big data solutions like Hadoop. The depth and breadth of support for the SQL language varies, but SQL smart professionals will be able to take advantage of these advances to enable highly interactive SQL on big data. Examples include Hadapt, Impala, Teradata Aster and EMC Greenplums Pivotal HD.  Unified Support for Structured, Unstructured and Semi-Structured Data as the growth of unstructured continues. IDC projects that the amount of digital data, mostly in the form of unstructured data, will grow 40-50% per year. By 2020, that total will reach 40 zettabytes. Unstructured data comes from email, forums, blogs, social networks, point-of-sale systems and machine generated data. In order to capture and analyze this mass amount of varied data, innovators are expanding their big data solutions beyond just capturing one or the other. In addition, we will see the emergence and adoption of solutions including the Oracle MDEX engine, Accumulo and Attivio to capture this varied data in a single store.  Advances in Search. Sifting through massive amounts of data to find that preverbal needle in the haystack is no simple task. Over time we will likely see more big data solutions injecting search support into their solutions. Leading the way in this endeavor are LucidWorks, IBM, Oracle through the acquisition of Endeca (full disclosure, I'm a former Endeca employee), Autonomy and MarkLogic. LucidWorks combines an open source stack of Lucene/Solr, Hadoop, Mahout and NLP.  Expanded ETL and ELT Support. Many have spoken about Hadoop's primary use case being to perform ETL workflows because of the batch nature of Hadoop. However, if you were to look at all of the pieces of infrastructure necessary to build and maintain a complex Hadoop based ETL solution, you might end up running the other way towards pure play ETL solutions from Informatica, Talend, Syncsort, CloverETL.  For years these have focused on building best-of-breed ETL solutions, now more frequently called Data Integration solutions. Pure play ETL vendors have worked diligently to ensure support for big data solutions. This includes support for not only ETL, but for ELT where the transforms are being executed by Hadoop inside of Hadoop. This would enable one to use the environments of popular ETL solutions against the strong capabilities of Hadoop. Overtime, these ETL pure plays will support a wide range of big data solutions from the NewSQL and NoSQL providers. In addition, I expect that many of the big data solutions will embed ETL and ELT support within their stacks, just as many of the traditional database vendors have done through embedding or acquisition of ETL solutions.   Big Data In Motion takes hold. As I've previously written ( Big Data \"In Motion\"—The Next Phase of Big Data ), the open source framework Apache Hadoop has traditionally been used for batch oriented processing of very large data sets in a distributed environment, primarily in the context of analytics. As brands begin to focus more on how to reign in and leverage the vast data assets available today for real-time decisioning, we anticipate significant impact and growth of “Big Data In Motion”. The “in motion” represents the real-time information flow for handling extremely large streams of data present in a variety of businesses, including capital markets, healthcare, energy and social media.  Added Data Mining and Analytic Functions. Industry leaders in the big data space understand the requirements to expand the underlying analytics and statistical capabilities in their platform. This goes beyond typical analytic functions into the world of very sophisticated data mining functionality. Teradata Aster Data includes a wide variety of analytic capabilities including support for statistical, text analytics, graph, sentiment analysis and in-database PMML execution through the support of Zementis. Other companies including IBM Netezza have embedded support for the popular R statistical language as well as Matrix engine, a parallelized linear algebra package. Over time, we will see a significant expansion of these capabilities across a broad range of big data solutions.  Gains in Popularity of the R Language . There is no doubt that R is becoming more and more popular as an open statistical language. Revolution Analytics has made significant progress in developing a \"production-grade\" version of R with performance enhancements and other enterprise features. Furthermore, they have developed solutions including R for Hadoop, R for IBM PureData as well as R for Big Data. Universities are also ramping up with courses in the R that will expose many students to the powerful capabilities of this language and equip them with skills required to perform complex statistical analysis. We will likely see it being embedded in many more big data solutions along with significant improvements in this language and higher performing capabilities.  As the big data ecosystem evolves, so must your business. Those implementing data-driven strategies will surpass the competition and thrive in today’s marketplace.    (image: Big Data / shutterstock ) Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Bob Zurek As SVP of Products, Bob oversees the strategic direction of Epsilon’s products, product marketing and product-specific client operations.

Handling The Big Data Faucet Like it? 370 comments 0 Posted December 2, 2011 Keywords : Agile Business Intelligence , analytics , Analytics , BI Issues , big data , data integration , social media , Data Warehousing , Social Data , Business Intelligence , Unstructured Data Between the millions of blogs, hundreds of sources of open social information streams along with the massive number of popular platforms for online conversations, companies will face a growing challenge in trying to keep up with a continuous flow of unstructured data coming out of a wide-open big data faucet. One of the biggest challenges is how information professionals approach getting a grip on this big data faucet with the goal of wrangling in only the most pertinent nuggets of insight critical to their business. Another challenge is that there are a wide range of api’s supported by these sources and when new sources come online, they to will have their own proprietary api’s. Many developers have either created or attempted to reverse engineer the data models associated with many of the popular social networks including Twitter and Facebook that map to the data returned out their API’s. Furthermore, some of these API’s are also specific to subsets of authorized functionality, for example, the Facebook analytic API available only to authorized users. Keeping these data models in synch can be quite challenging, especially when multiple social data sources are required to provide better overall analysis for the target business user or business. An example would be the data from Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. The other issue is that most of the data that is critically important from these social sources is unstructured in nature. The key to making these easier to combine is the evolution of expanded data stores that support no pre-defined schema and that support structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. These new sources of critically important unstructured data are driving this change in the industry. Data integration tools are also changing so that they are able to hang off a variety of new social data firehoses and support unstructured solutions like Hadoop. An ETL tools JSON adapter or interface is frequently used to connect into everything from the Facebook Graph API to the Twitter API. Many data integration tool vendors have also announced support for connecting into Hadoop. The Hadoop project has also created tooling for integration. A good example is Sqoop. Finally new front-end innovations are emerging to help business intelligence professionals overcome the challenges of analyzing the combination of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Just like data stores that are being enhanced to support a variety of data, front-end solutions for analyzing, visualizing and discovering information from this data are coming quickly. Finally, business intelligence professionals are quickly skilling up on these new discovery based solutions very quickly as the pressure to analyze all this data continues to bear down on them. With all these challenges, comes great new innovation for the future of business intelligence and data management. Today, our industry is going thru a very large inflection point and change and with this change comes huge opportunities to innovate. We are now only scratching the surface of what is possible. We saw this when mainframe computing went to client/server computing and when client/server computing went the way of the web and now the web moving more and more to mobile. These shifts of the past have created opportunities and now this big data shift is doing it again.

The Next Generation BI Professional - Things Will Be Very Different Like it? 216 comments 0 Posted December 14, 2011 Keywords : Analytics , big data analytics , business intelligence , careers , Hadoop , MapReduce , Best Practices , Open Source , Business Intelligence The next generation business intelligence professional is not one who has experienced complex deployments, lengthy project time frames and unpredictable results dealing with a big stack of software with more bells and whistles than they really cared about. Nope, the next generation business intelligence is going to be very different in many ways. Let’s explore. Reports are no longer something that you get from a printer. The tablet or mobile device is the printer. Your reports are available anytime, anywhere and not on a piece of paper pulled from a LaserJet printer down the hall. The new BI kids in town will likely have been deeply exposed to search technologies. They grew up using Google, Bing and Yahoo and other search technologies to quickly find and discover information. It’s simply a natural part of growing up in a search driven society and you can almost be assured of the fact that a highly dynamic search box will show up in the business intelligence solution they build. They expect that their business user will demand search-driven business intelligence. They will be well versed in the value of unstructured data for their business consumers. These new BI professionals understand that unstructured data contains critical business information that can have a significant impact on the business. After all, these BI professionals frequently participate in online social forums, use Facebook, Twitter and other forms of social media. Why wouldn’t the business want to garner insight from these and other forms of unstructured data. Agile Development and Deployment is how they learned to build and deploy high valued business intelligence software in short bursts of time. They think in terms of frequent and fast iterations and short cycles of meeting the business intelligence goals of their internal customers without them having to wait months and years for a successful solution. Open Source or Commercial?  They really won’t care. They will simply use the best solution at hand that helps them rapidly meet their objective of getting high value business intelligence and analytic application to their users that deliver WOW. Security Savvy. These future BI professionals will know a great deal about information security. They recognize that information is the new competitive advantage and that they must ensure the integrity and security of the businesses information assets. Understands “Big Data”. The future BI professional will clearly have a handle on big data. It would not be unusual for them to have experience with technologies including Hadoop, Map/Reduce and Columnar Databases. However, they will also recognize that business users want information at the speed of a click and that these users will likely be using highly relevant data marts that support their business unit rather than the overall enterprise data warehouse that houses petabytes of information. They will frequently be called data scientists and possibly even have a degree in Data Sciences.  Balancing the use of Eye Candy. Although these business intelligence professionals value good visualization capabilities in their BI solutions of choice, they also recognize that their needs to be a balance. They get this from being overwhelmed for years with eye candy on the web, why would they want to pepper their end users visualizations that may end up getting in their way. It won't be unusual for these business intelligence professionals to be deploying voice driven SIRI like interfaces on mobile devices. They will likely see their users talking into their iPhones saying \"What is the current revenue for my east coast sales team as of today?\" No more looking at the screen.  Driven To Enable Collaboration In The Context Of Business Intelligence. These new BI pros believe that the power of the individual is only surpassed by the power of the team when it comes to gaining further insights into business analytics. They will expect that future business intelligence solutions for their end users will have built-in collaborative capabilities for enabling shared insight and analysis. Thin continues to be IN with these new BI professionals. Fat clients are a thing of the past. The browser is everything and they wouldn’t think for a minute to use anything but the browser to get at key business metrics and deep analytics. We are in for exciting times when it comes to the next wave of business intelligence and analytics. While the software industry moves faster and faster on the innovation front, a new wave of BI professional will be there to take advantage of these innovations in order build the next generation of business intelligence and analytic applications that satisfy their end user desire for better insight and analysis of their business and business units.

Data Design Matters Like it? 219 comments 2 Posted December 28, 2012 Keywords : data design , Data Quality , Modeling As important as it is, data modeling has always had a geeky, faintly impractical tinge to some. I’ve seen application development projects proceed with a suboptimal, “good enough”, model. The resulting systems might otherwise be well-architected, but sometimes strange vulnerabilities emerge that track directly to data design flaws. Recently I saw an example where a “good enough” data design, similar to the one pictured, enabled a significant application bug. My fictionalized model illustrates this case’s anti-pattern. Say there’s an order management system tracking Orders, Order Lines, and “Order Line Events”, customer transactions involving an order item. The Order Line table includes a foreign key to the Order table. The Order Line Event table includes foreign keys to both the Order Line and the Order. The latter relationship from Order Line Event to Order is logically unnecessary. Each Order line is related to exactly one Order, so if an Order Line Event relates to an Order Line it must also relate to a specific order. Beyond being unnecessary, in this case the extra relationship turned out to be harmful. Somehow the online system had a bug that updated an Event’s relationship to a different Order than the related Order Lines. So a single Order Line Event could be related to two separate Orders, one through the Order Line and the other directly through the Changes/Changed By relationship. In the real example there were some specific impacts that I won’t go into, but you can imagine the possibilities. Here are just three: Customer service representatives addressing customer complaints have invalid records of negative events Customer contact reporting and analysis is skewed Processes that purge old records may be unable to delete orders with mismatched foreign keys. Say you want to delete all data for Order 1. If an Order Line Event relates to both Order 1 and Order 2, the foreign key to Order 2 prevents delete of the Event unless Order 2 is also being deleted. So, a database design that seems imperfect but “good enough” in fact isn’t. In this case it would have been well worth taking extra time during design to prevent the chance of subtle but significant errors in the application.

It also might be reasonable for there to be two different \"master tables\" referenced by the two foreign keys, but in this case both ultimately point to the same Order table. Sadly, the non-null foreign keys (which I didn't mention in the post) prevent the very reasonable possibilities you raise in your second paragraph. Many thanks for the comment! Bob Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Like it? 195 January 4, 2013 Venkata Bodapati says: Even if you do not have the extra relationship, nothing really prevents the online system to update the order number unless it is part of the primary key/index (in which case, updating the order number will not be permitted even with the sub-optimal design.)  In this case, it looks like they have two order number columns in the event table that join to different master tables? Are the primary keys (autogenerated) surrogate keys? Looks like they wanted to use the events table to multiple purposes - like register line level as well as order level events. In such case, they can have an event id as a primary key (and the event can either be at whole order level or a order-line level; optional relationships.) For the order level events, the line numbers will be null (meaning it applies to the entire order.)

How Analytics Can Improve Collaboration Behavior Like it? 365 comments 4 Posted October 18, 2010 Keywords : collaboration , Predictive Analytics Enterprises deploy collaboration and social software to allow employees to more effectively address business problems and identify business opportunities.  This software helps users find content from which they can learn and locate other people with whom they can collaborate. Success will depend on how well the application enables users to find what they are seeking, so application designers and administrators must understand which user experiences create successful outcomes–and which lead to failure.    Designers and developers can use analytics to find out more about user experience in these applications. Steps could include:  1.      Determining the usage frequency of specific tools (for example, wikis, blogs, discussion forums, etc.) within multi-functional collaboration applications and suites 2.      Tracking the individual actions (such as clicks and searches) taken to find relevant documents and people 3.      Documenting the sequences of specific actions taken during a collaborative efforts 4.      Determining whether there are patterns in resource use based on the user’s position or role in the organization 5.      Gathering user-generated ratings on the relevance and helpfulness of discovered content and individuals  Analysis of frequency will show which tools users find most effective for surfacing knowledge and enabling collaboration. Information about the individual actions taken while using those tools (such as clicks made and search terms used), can lead to a better understanding of how effective particular tools are in helping an individual find the knowledge they need.  Examination of collaboration activity sequences reveals specific patterns of actions that lead to successful collaboration outcomes; application designers can build those patterns into the application to maximize successful knowledge transfer and collaboration.  Along the same lines, analyzing user-generated data (such as tags, ratings, and rankings) in relation to an individual’s job or role in the organization can lead to a better understanding of what content and expertise a particular type of user is seeking. Application administrators can then present the most relevant content and people to a specific user, so the individual does not have to navigate or search to find it.  This model of analytics-driven change can take on added power through the use of real-time analytics to dynamically alter the user experience. By observing and analyzing an individual’s current actions and work role, and comparing that to historical data, systems can automatically suggest not only valuable content and people that have knowledge, but also tools that will help the user actively collaborate with others to accomplish a task.  Social analytics is still relatively young, compared to business intelligence activities that focus on structured data residing in enterprise systems. However, the basics of data analysis apply just as well to collaboration as to other types of business activity. In collaboration, as in financial transactions, post-usage analysis provides insight, but dynamic analysis–when executed and applied correctly—can add even more value.

Its has just about as many meanings as \"freedom\" or \"agility\". And its something everyone want more of, so everything gets label as such. Collaboration specifically has to do with making new working agreements. Sharing information, or even basic cooperation, are valuable but totally different. Its time we apply some actual analysis to the value of social tools instead of just assuming that because we \"tweet\" something it is good. Evan Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Like it? 352 October 21, 2010 A guest says: Thanks for your comment and question on my article. As you may know, most Web-based collaboration systems, especially social software, log user actions in a database. Data captured includes log-ins to the system and access of specific components, pages, content objects, and feedback mechanisms within it. In essence, every click made by a user is captured in the database. Analysis of this usage data, via tools like TIBCO Spotfire, can generate insights as to the success or failure of user experience within the system. For example, some organizations analyze logs from searches conducted by their employees to determine: - what terms are most frequently searched - what search terms lead to successful identification of content and people-based expertise needed - what search terms are being used unsuccessfully (as determined by user abandonment of the search process) This data is often pulled ad-hoc from the search logs, or it may be pushed to an analyst in a pre-defined static report or via an interactive dashboard. I believe that all collaboration systems interactions (not just search attempts) should be monitored in this way by developers and system administrators so they can improve the experience of users, including the eventual outcome of their collaboration attempts within the system. I hope this clarifies the vision of my original post for you.

I recognize how social media would allow the exchange of ideas, sharing of knowledge and information and perhaps identify failures but how would that data be identified, organized and reported on? Do you see some sort of report-out for development teams that isolates the social media contribution each have made and the subsequent outcome? Maybe I am missing something from your post?

In fact, the right data analysts can get you to the all-elusive “ One Version of the Truth ,” then move you beyond the truths into predictive analytics , according to Adam Neary ( adamrneary ), a self-described “data guy.” They can also build better business cases, and implement statistics actively to drive tangible business results. But how can you be sure you hire the “right” data analyst? Analytics expert Meta Brown ( metabrown312 ) said the key to the hiring process is to sit down and figure out your company’s needs and goals for yourself rather than rely on someone else like a recruiter to work it all out for you. After all, you have more invested in hiring the best person for the job than any recruiter does, she said.   If you don’t determine your own needs and goals first, you won’t be able to determine exactly what you need from an analyst. According to Meta, here are three questions to ask to find the right talent: Why do you need an analyst? Is your business facing some problem that you want to address like the high cost of acquiring customers or decreasing profits? Or maybe your business is doing OK but there are other opportunities you can pursue. What’s the value of analytics to your business? Address the needs you’ve identified and estimate the value of each one to your business. Remember investing a million bucks to solve a problem that’s only costing you half a million is probably not a good idea. You should, however, spend the money necessary to fix the problems that are causing your company to lose money. What do you need that you and your current staff can’t do? Are there things you need to do but can’t because you just don’t have the time to do them? Maybe you just need help analyzing certain data because you don’t know exactly how to do it. Neary said when you interview a potential candidate first tell him about your team then ask him to talk about how he would work with your team and which problems he would prioritize. And ensure that the candidate understands the business impacts of the analytics projects he has worked on. Be sure he didn’t run numbers just for analysis’ sake. Once you establish your own needs and goals, you will need to assess a candidates hard and soft skills .   Here are two critical areas where your candidate needs to shine. Does the candidate have data visualization skills? Your data analyst should understand graphs, maps, and charts, as well a dashboards, scorecards, data mashups, and even Excel workbooks to get the right information to the right people Can the candidate collaborate and persuade? In real life we need “soft skills” to communicate, persuade, collaborate and work with others. For a data analyst who needs to gather requirements, frame a problem, elicit data or manage a client, the ability to collaborate and persuade effectively is essential. The data analysts are out there, and they want to find you as much as you want to find them, Meta said. If you follow these tips, you may soon be saying, “You’re hired.”   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Brett Stupakevich Social Analytics Product Marketing Manager See complete profile Would you like to contribute to this site?

Data Science: Equality at Last! Like it? 182 comments 0 Posted October 9, 2012 Keywords : Analytics , Business Rules , data scientists , gender equality , Data Warehousing , Big Data , Business Intelligence , Statistics Despite the vast literature around Big Data, the “Data Agents of Change” are still a mysterious bunch.  They are called “Data Scientists”, but who are they really? We don’t know what the exact job description for a Data Scientist is or how different they are from their ancestors, the Data Analysts.  In fact, when I asked Merv Adrian who now works for Gartner, what a Data Scientist was, he answered: “a Data Scientist is a Data Analyst who lives in San Francisco.”  Merv might have meant it as a joke - but he might not be too far off.   As research indicates , the distinction between a Data Analyst and Data Scientist is not clear.  Both are highly educated (85% have college education) and their salaries are similarly correlated to location and experience. Another problem with Data Scientists is how needed they are: according to McKinsey, the US will need close to 200,000 analytical experts & 1.5 million more data-literate managers by 2015 to take advantage of “Big Data”.   Where will we find them?  There are lots of options such as upleveling your Data Analysts or training passionate and statistically astute employees.   The unexpected gender equality phenomenon in the Data World could be an opportunity:  according to the survey, compensation for women is slightly higher than for men in data science and related fields.  To put that in perspective, Census Bureau estimates put the real wage gender gap somewhere at the 5-7% range, meaning that even after controlling for education level, time spent on maternity leave, occupation, and other factors, women tend to earn about 5% less than men (and the gap trends wider, not narrower, as workers age.) The survey group was comprised of about 15% women and 85% men, which suggests that, compared to the population as a whole, men are overrepresented among the data sample still. Yet, the insight is worth considering, because it appears that women in data science have the opportunity to close the wage gap in a hurry.  And even if by some data bias the true income figures for the industry aren’t quite as rosy, we love the idea that more women get into the tech profession through Data - it’s an awesome industry to be in.   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Bruno Aziza Bruno Aziza  is the author of “Drive Business Performance” and Chief Marketing Officer at Alpine Data Labs.  Prior to Alpine Data Labs, Bruno worked at BusinessObjects, Apple and Microsoft.  Bruno has guest lectured at Stanford University in the US and the Cranfield School of Management in the UK.  He was educated in France, Germany, the UK and the US.  You can connect with him directly ...

What You Need to Know About Duqu Like it? 410 comments 0 Posted December 16, 2011 Keywords : virus , Best Practices , Security Duqu is a stealthy computer virus with a hidden agenda... Ever ything that you need to know about Duqu: Duqu was reported to antivirus vendors around the 14th of October, 2011, but it has been in the wild since November of 2010. Since then there have been varients (updated copies with additional features or upgrades to code) released. It has been billed as the next Stuxnet , the son of Stuxnet, or a Stuxnet clone. In reality, Duqu is actually more like a payload of Stuxnet rather than the entire attack campagin, because it is a backdoor package dropped via other means. The reason why Stuxnet was considered to be so advanced was in large part because of its varied numbers of unpatched exploits that it used to ensure successful infection. Lets take a look at the similarities: Duqu uses code segments that can be identical to or very close to those used in the Stuxnet payload. Both Stuxnet and Duqu use signed code in order to appear to antivirus, Windows, and users as legitimate code. Registers a remote procedure call server in a very similar fashion to Stuxnet Has the same list of antivirus products, in the same order as Stuxnet except one more product was added. Checks for running processes in a manner similar to Stuxnet Both Stuxnet and Duqu use “import by hash” techniques instead of directly importing function names. These similarities are code similarities, which means that Stuxnet and Duqu seem to share a common resource base, code base, and methodology in loading and running executables. Essentially we can think of the ways Duqu and Stuxnet install and launch themselves as being similar enough to warrant either worry that it is the same perpetrator of Stuxnet, or that they have access to the source code of the Stuxnet threat. There are plenty of significant differences, however, namely that Duqu only performs information-gathering techniques. In comparison, Stuxnet destroyed industrial equipment, disabled safety systems, and was overtly malicious. Duqu’s most significant malicious payload is its spying ability. Duqu infections currently have the following functionalities: View processes, accounts, and domain information View drive names/information Ability to take screenshots View network and network setup Keylogger Window name enumeration Share enumeration File exploration on all drives Duqu sends this information to a command-and-control server currently located in India, the IP address of which is hard-coded into the Duqu payloads. Interestingly enough, Duqu is also set to destroy itself after 36 days of infection, a probable reason for why it has been able to live so long in the wild without detection. Targets: Duqu appears to be mostly targeting some industrial control systems and Certificate authorities, probably for the purposes of gaining information to be used in further exploits. CA compromises are also lucrative because of their use in malware.  Duqu itself is a sterling example of the use of compromised CA information because it uses a stolen certificate to sign itself as legitimate software, fooling the operating system, antivirus, and user alike with the ruse. Infection Methods: At first, Duqu was largely reported to have come from the same folks who created Stuxnet.  This simply doesn’t have to be the case.  The techniques could have been copied or even stolen wholesale by the malware authors.  Duqu also behaves differently and uses different infection methods.  Whereas Stuxnet was focused on remote exploitation or spread-exploitation, Duqu’s exploit of choice (MS11-087, which has since been patched) is a trojan-horse method that requires a user to open an infected Microsoft Word document. What Can We Learn From This? Don’t trust the initial reports, be wary, but try not to buy into the paranoia because it’s important to have measured and rational reactions to security threats so your customers and users don’t view you as the “boy who cried wolf”.  The sad thing about Duqu is that it would be very hard to detect without antivirus signatures.  With it being signed, silent, patient and auto-deleting, it is a threat that is difficult to detect or defend against unless you have the proper security infrastructure ( Intrusion detection system , VLANs, exfil firewalls, Data Loss Prevention, ect…).  Use this as an excuse to justify increased security expenditures if you don’t have things up-to-spec.

Greening the Workplace 1.0: Going Paperless Like it? 83 comments 0 Posted July 11, 2016 Keywords : Data Warehousing , Cloud Computing Transforming your office into a less wasteful and more energy efficient space really doesn't represent that great a challenge - especially since the technology available today makes it so easy. And while it's true your actions alone aren't going to make environmental issues suddenly go away, you should still be pro-active in reducing your organization's ecological footprint: on top of it being the socially responsible thing to do, every step you take towards that goal will ultimately  save your business money , which definitely represents a strong incentive to going green. In other words, there's no excuse not to take a good look around your work space and consider what you can do to change your habits, namely in terms of paper consumption. Here are  a few facts  that will give you a clearer understanding on why the environmental footprint of a single sheet of bleached white paper is off the charts: it takes 324 liters [85.6 U.S gallons!] of water just to produce 1 KG of paper - which is already insane, but even more so when you understand just how precious a resource water is fast becoming. Yet it's even crazier when you consider that Americans casually throw away 4.5 million tons of that office paper every year. That's just what we discard, but even the paper we actually use at work tends to be redundant. Recent studies indicate that 45% of documents sitting in filing cabinets are nothing but duplicates and worse, 80% of those documents will never be referenced again. On the positive side, however, there's a slew of affordable, easily accessed and implemented technologies out there that will either eliminate, or at least substantially reduce, the amount of paper needed to run most businesses: 1. Ask your employees to start thinking about the amount of paper they use and the effect it has on the environment. Let them know it's important to you and to try and reduce the amount of paper they use as much as possible. Meanwhile, set the office printer default to double-sided and make sure your employees keep, re-use and eventually recycle scrap paper at every opportunity. Then reduce your font sizes a notch, use smaller margins, and edit the “fit to page” layout. These are all little things but collectively they'll make a noticable difference to your paper consumption. 2. If you haven't done so already, switch over to electronic invoicing. Who mails invoices out anymore anyway? There's plenty of inexpensive software out there to simplify the process, while most of your customers will probably  prefer being billed electronically  anyway. You'll also save on expensive paper, ink, envelopes, stamps, and the time required to put it all together and go over to the post office to mail everything out. Throw in the speed and efficiancy that comes with electronic invoicing and it's really a no-brainer. 3. Use online fax services. Yes, I know, the good old fax machine seems pretty antiquated these days. However, it remains surprisingly common in some industries - doctors, for instance, continue to use faxes in an effort to ensure  HIPAA compliance . Certain law offices and real estate agents also depend on them to distribute contracts. All that has been made obsolete by digital signatures, secure online consultations and online fax services. 4. Use digital signature services. Most of you probably already realize that in most jurisdictions, an email message is considered a legal document. So if somebody confirms a given price to you in an email and doesn't respect the agreement, your original email will serve as a fairly powerful resource for you in court. Consequently, for in-house communications like confirming purchase orders or approving decisions, you need nothing more than an email server. Things gets a little trickier when you're dealing with external and/or more complex documents, or agreements that are reached in person and in different places, such as real estate deals. Fortunately, there's no shortage of inexpensive software services available that enable you to  imprint your digital signature  from your tablet or smart phone, or imbed multiple signatures on the same document and share them in the cloud. When you stop to think about how much paper needs to be printed out just to sign your average full-length contract, the ink and paper expenses alone might be all the justification you need to start seriously considering going the digital signature route. 5. Go digital with everything. Do you really need to print out an agenda for every employee for every meeting you conduct? Of course not. Why print out employee manuals or any other in-house documents when you can just make the information available online or through an email? How many of those documents are just going to be discarded or filed away without ever being looked at anyway? There are of course countless other ways you can do your bit for the health of the planet - and your wallet - that don't involve reducing or eliminating your use of paper. For example, switch over to LED lighting and/or try to use as much natural light as possible, switch off your air conditioners at night, use green cleaning products, reduce water consumption with the good ol' brick in the toilet tank trick, avoid unneccesary packing materials by buying in bulk - the list is practically endless. But start with paper. As you can see there's nothing to lose by going down that route and plenty to gain.

IBM Drops $1B for Merge Healthcare Like it? 237 comments 0 Posted August 7, 2015 IBM has announced that it has purchased Merge Healthcare care for a staggering $1B. The move to buy Merge was spurred by IBM's initiative to become deeply entrenched within the healthcare IT industry. As a result of the acquisition, IBM plans to add additional functionalities into its popular Watson healthcare analytics platform. Some cloud analysts have mentioned that the move to buy Merge essentially gives Watson medical imaging capabilities. As of now, Watson is a numbers crunching supercomputer that can be used as a cloud service. By acquiring Merge Healthcare, IBM's Watson will be able to look at medical diagnostic images and gather data. Once that data is gathered, new images will be compared to a database of others which will help doctors determine a diagnosis. Watson could also use statistics gathered from its new imaging capabilities that help doctors give patients advice in case an abnormality is discovered. Merge Healthcare has been in this arena for quite sometime; Merge mentions that its services are in use in over 7,500 healthcare sites. Of course, Merge & IBM are using HIPAA approved methods when handling all of this data. “Healthcare will be one of IBM’s biggest growth areas over the next 10 years, which is why we are making a major investment to drive industry transformation and to facilitate a higher quality of care,” says John Kelly , SVP at IBM's Research and Solutions Portfolio. “Giving Watson ‘eyes’ on medical images unlocks entirely new possibilities for the industry,” adds Kelly. By using Watson to help analyze medical images, doctors can get data that will help them make the right diagnosis. Experts say that some doctors still use manual scanning and analysis techniques. Watson would make the most sense for these doctors as it could work to prevent them from making a faulty diagnosis on a patient.

How Web Analytics Can Help Your Business Like it? 313 comments 0 Posted March 26, 2013 Keywords : Analytics , google analytics , metrics , Social Media Analytics , Market Research , Social Data , Data Mining , Web Analytics , Big Data , Business Intelligence , Data Management , Marketing One of the tenets of successful marketing is understanding and appealing to your customer. Knowing what they want and how to provide it can be the difference between staying ahead of the game and falling behind. Web analytics tools can be extremely powerful when it comes to increasing this understanding. What are Web Analytics? Web Analytics are the collection of online data used to understand and optimize web presence. It turns the qualitative experience of visiting a website into a quantitative snapshot of everything about your users. Measurement – Google Analytics is the most popular measurement tool for web analytics. It’s free, powerful, and comprehensive enough for most small businesses. Popular advanced web analytics packages include Web Trends and Omniture’s SiteCatalyst. Analytics work by placing a code on your website or web presence that monitors information about users. Collection – Once the analytics script is installed, information about users is collected. Everything from visits and traffic sources to user locations and page views are recorded, with hundreds of additional metrics that you can review. Reporting – All the information is summarized and displayed on an analytics dashboard. You can create custom dashboards to display important information in one place as well. View reports on which websites are referring traffic to your website, what search engine keywords you’re ranking, and pages users are viewing just to name a few. How can I use Web Analytics to make better decisions? Web Analytics help you gain a better understanding of your customers, allowing you to make changes to your web presence to improve their experience and increase leads, sales, or conversions. Analyze the value of each visitor. Segment visitors by location. Segment by traffic sources. Browse referral keywords. All the data are there to analyze your web presence and strengthen your marketing efforts. Traffic Sources – Analytics provides insight into the value of some of your advertising media. If you are paying someone for a link to your website or sponsoring an online promotion, you can see exactly how many people were referred from their website, and what they did on the website. The same goes for paid search campaigns and banner advertisements. Usability – Analytics also provide data for each page on your website. You can view bounce rates (the number of visitors only viewing one page) and exit rates (the number of people who leave a certain page). You can also set up a conversion funnel to see where you lose people at different points in the process. Doing this can help you find weaknesses with your website so you can improve those pages, increasing conversion rates. Key Analytic Metrics to Monitor There are hundreds of metrics we could discuss. But like most things, there is a need to weigh the amount of time it takes to analyze every last metric versus how useful they are for making business decisions. For most small- and medium-sized businesses, these metrics are great ones to start with to help you understand key components of your web presence. Average Time on Site/Page – The length of time visitors spend on your website can be an indicator of the quality of the visitor coming to your website or the quality of your web presence. Are visitors engaging? Are they reading your content? The longer visitors are spending on your website, the higher quality the experience. Bounce/Exit Rates – Analytics lets us know where people are leaving the website. Home page and contact pages naturally have higher bounce/exit rates, but if there are high rates on other pages, you might want to consider changing layouts or content to keep them engaged. Pages/Visitor – Another indicator of visitor engagement is the number of pages each visitor views. If they are viewing too many pages with low time on sites, it’s an indicator that visitors are having trouble finding what they are looking for. Usually, however, more pages/visits indicate a higher-quality website where visitors are surfing and finding information they’re interested in reading. Contact Form Submissions – Conversions are the reason you have a website. For e-commerce sites, the goal is sales. For most small businesses, it’s phone calls and contact forms. Using conversion tracking, we can measure contact submissions and measure the successes. Organic Search Referrals – Search engines are the largest driver of online traffic. When you rank well organically, you’re receiving free, targeted traffic to your website. Analytics help you find out which keywords you’re ranking for, which ones are driving traffic, and how those visitors are performing when on the website. Social Sources – The social revolution is on, and web analytics are doing their best to embrace it. Google Analytics has a section devoted to social traffic sources, so you can view and analyze the impact of your social presence and find the value they are delivering to your website. Conclusion Remember, Google Analytics takes only a few minutes to install and is completely free. Even if you don’t think it’s something you’ll use in the short-term, you may decide to use it later – or hire a professional (trust me, they’ll appreciate it). Having those additional data are only going to help.

Data, Data, Data: Communicating Successfully in the Deluge Like it? 251 comments 0 Posted September 1, 2015 Keywords : Hadoop , Data Quality , Business Intelligence Good marketing is effective communication. You’re letting people know what you do, what you make, in a way that makes sense to them, feels vital, maintains their attention. Now that big data is in the mix, there’s potential for a ton of noise. The business best able to cull what’s vital from the deluge of data, turn it into information and communicate it loud and clear will ride the landslide of data to success. Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Sessions said , “Communication is two-sided – vital and profound communication makes demands also on those who are to receive it… demands in the sense of concentration, of genuine effort to receive what is being communicated.” The average adult attention span is eight seconds , shorter than that of a goldfish. Marketers make demands on the span. We ask people to pay attention, please do something . We can use big data to make sure we’re not wasting anyone’s eight seconds. The less attention people are capable of paying, the more attention becomes a commodity—the more valuable it becomes. We've got to be asking the right questions and making the right demands of the attention span. Time is valuable, and in a sense big data represents time. The time it takes for a customer to access important technical support information from your homepage. The amount of time a car takes to come to a complete stop with worn out tires on an icy road. When we manage data well, we’re indicating we care about people’s time—we’re showing we care about what the numbers represent. In order to manage the data and use it effectively, we need software solutions like Hadoop, for which the global market is reportedly growing at around 55 percent . Using Hadoop is like using plumbing instead of manually hauling your water from the well. But then it’s a matter of what we do with the water. It’s the quality of what we make that counts. Flipkart is a company focusing in on giving customers quality through their use of big data. They want to simulate the capabilities of the human brain. They want to turn data into intelligence. Tim Fletcher said, “Transforming big data into intelligence is simply about seeing the existing data in a new and meaningful way to help you strengthen your business, performance, productivity or relationships.” Companies that use data intelligently are 5% more productive, and 6% more profitable, than companies that aren’t data-driven. In the case of Flipkart, they want to understand what their users want. They’re already the leading shopping app in India. But they won’t sit back, and by asking questions about user experience they are really doing a kind of marketing. The best customer service presents a picture of who you are to the customer. This picture is the one that ends up representing you to the consumer. That picture Flipkart wants to create is alluring. The human brain is capable of empathy, which means Flipkart’s new model would be simulating empathy for the user. Is it possible? How could computers be capable of understanding how we feel? Through the use of constant data feedback and advanced programming, a computer wouldn’t actually be able to have empathy, per se—we haven’t figured out how to make synthetic materials have feelings. But it could have a level of understanding that feels like empathy. The Flipkart app is paying so much attention to specific user experience metrics, and harnessing the use of image recognition in such a way, that it very well may feel like you’re walking through the store with a knowledgeable shopping attendant who can answer your questions immediately. And, if the app is using data to communicate effectively, the questions it asks you will never be annoying, leading, or superfluous.               Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Daniel Matthews I'm a freelance writer who specializes in marketing, tech, social media, and anything super-interesting in the world right now.

Scale, Structure and Semantics Like it? 242 comments 0 Posted June 8, 2012 Keywords : faceted search , semantic technology , semantic web , Data Visualization This morning I had the pleasure to present a keynote address at the Semantic Technology & Business Conference (SemTechBiz) . I’ve had a long and warm relationship with the semantic technology community — especially with Marco Neumann and the New York Semantic Web Meetup . But I’m not exactly a fanboy of the semantic web, and I wasn’t sure how the audience would respond to some of my more provocative assertions. Fortunately the reception was very positive. Several people approached me afterwards to thank me for presenting a balanced argument for combining big data with structured representations and for raising HCIR issues. A couple of people felt that faceted search was old news. I’m delighted that faceted search is becoming increasingly common, but there is still a lot of opportunity to use it more often and more effectively, And I was pleasantly surprised at the interest in discussing extensions of faceted search to address relationships between entities, as well as other nuances. I’ll have to dive into those in future posts. For now, I hope you enjoy the slides, and I encourage you to ask questions in the comments.

Information Cascades, Revisited Like it? 137 comments 0 Posted June 12, 2012 Keywords : Decision Management , Unstructured Data A couple of years ago, I blogged about an information cascade problem I’d read about in  David Easley  and  Jon Kleinberg ‘s textbook on  Networks, Crowds, and Markets . To recall the problem (which they themselves borrowed from  Lisa Anderson  and  Charles Holt : The experimenter puts an urn at the front of the room with three marbles in it; she announces that there is a 50% chance that the urn contains two red marbles and one blue marble, and a 50% chance that the urn contains two blue marbles and one red marble…one by one, each student comes to the front of the room and draws a marble from the urn; he looks at the color and then places it back in the urn without showing it to the rest of the class. The student then guesses whether the urn is majority-red or majority-blue and publicly announces this guess to the class. The fascinating result is that the sequence of guesses locks in on a single color as soon as two consecutive students agree. For example, if the first two marbles drawn are blue, then all subsequent students will guess blue. If the urn is majority-red, then it turns out there is a 16/21 probability that the sequence will converge to red and a 5/21 probability that it will converge to blue. Let me explain why I find this problem so fascinating. Consider a scenario where you are among a group of people faced with the single binary decision — let’s say, choosing red or blue — and that each of you is independently tasked with recommending the best decision given your own judgement and all available information. Assume further that each of you is perfectly rational and that each of your prior decisions (i.e., without knowing what anyone else thinks) is based on independent and identically distributed random variables . Let’s follow the example above, in which each participant in the decision process has a prior corresponding to a Bernoulli random variable with probability p = 2/3. If each of you makes a decision independently, then the expected fraction of participants who makes the right decision is 2/3. But you could do better if you have a chance to observe others’ independent decision making first. For example, if you get to witness 100 independent decisions, then you have a very low probability of going wrong by voting the majority. If you’d like the gory details, review the cumulative distribution function of binomial random variables . On the other hand, if the decisions happen sequentially and every person has access to all of the previous decisions, then we see an information cascade. Rationally, it makes sense to let previous decisions influence your own — and indeed 16/21 > 2/3. But 16/21 is still almost a one in four chance of making the wrong decision, even after you witness 100 previous decisions. We are wasting a lot of independent input because of how participants are incented. I can’t help wondering how changing the incentives could affect the outcome of this process. What would happen if participants were rewarded based, in whole or in part, on the accuracy of the participants who guess after them? Consider as an extreme case rewarding all participants based solely on the accuracy of the final participant’s guess. In that case, the optimal strategy for all but the last participant is to ignore previous participants’ guesses and vote based solely on their own independent judgements. Then the final participant combines these judgements with his or her own and votes based on the majority. The result makes optimal use of all participants’ independent judgments, despite the sequential decision process. But what if individuals are rewarded based on a combination of individual and collective success? Consider the 3rd participant in our example who draws a red marble after the previous participants guess blue. Let’s say that there are 5 participants in total. If the reward is entirely based on individual success, the 3rd participant will vote blue, yielding an expected reward of 2/3. If the reward is entirely based on group success, the 3rd participant will vote red, yielding an expected reward of 20/27 (details left as an exercise for the reader). If we make the reward evenly split between individual success and group success, the 3rd participant will still vote blue — the benefit from helping the group will not be enough to overcome the cost to the individual reward. There’s a lot more math in the details of this problem, e.g. “ The Mathematics of Bayesian Learning Traps “, by Simon Loertscher and Andrew McLennan. But there’s a simple take-away: incentives are crucial in determining how we best exploit our collective wisdom. Something to think about the next time you’re on a committee.

Panos Ipeirotis Speaking at LinkedIn about Crowdsourcing! Like it? 177 comments 0 Posted August 31, 2012 Keywords : crowdsourcing , linkedin , Knowledge Management Sharing knowledge is part of our core culture at LinkedIn, whether it’s through  hackdays  or contributions to  open-source projects . We actively participate in academic conferences, such as  KDD ,  SIGIR , RecSys , and CIKM , as well as industry conferences like QCON  and  Strata . Beyond sharing our own knowledge, we provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to share their insights with the technical community. We host an  Tech Talk series  at our Mountain View headquarters that we open up to the general public. Some of our recent speakers include Coursera founders  Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng , UC-Berkeley professor Joe Hellerstein ,  and Hadapt Chief Scientist Daniel Abadi . It’s an excellent opportunity for people with shared professional interests can reconnect with people they know, as well as make new connections. For those who cannot attend, we offer a live stream . Our next talk will be by  Panos Ipeirotis , a professor at NYU and one of the world’s top experts on crowdsourcing. Here is a full description: Crowdsourcing: Achieving Data Quality with Imperfect Humans Friday, September 7, 2012 at 3:00 PM LinkedIn ( map ) Crowdsourcing is a great tool to collect data and support machine learning — it is the ultimate form of outsourcing. But crowdsourcing introduces budget and quality challenges that must be addressed to realize its benefits. In this talk, I will discuss the use of crowdsourcing for building robust machine learning models quickly and under budget constraints. I’ll operate under the realistic assumption that we are processing imperfect labels that reflect random and systematic error on the part of human workers. I will also describe our “beat the machine” system engages humans to improve a machine learning system by discovering cases where the machine fails and fails while confident on being correct. I’ll use classification problems that arise in online advertising. Finally, I’ll discuss our latest results showing that mice and Mechanical Turk workers are not that different after all. Panos Ipeirotis is an Associate Professor and George A. Kellner Faculty Fellow at the Department of Information, Operations, and Management Sciences at Leonard N. Stern School of Business of New York University. His recent research interests focus on crowdsourcing and on mining user-generated content on the Internet. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Columbia University in 2004, with distinction. He has received three “Best Paper” awards (IEEE ICDE 2005, ACM SIGMOD 2006, WWW 2011), two “Best Paper Runner Up” awards (JCDL 2002, ACM KDD 2008), and is also a recipient of a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation. If you’re in the Bay Area, I encourage you to attend in person — Panos is a great speaker, and it’s also a great opportunity to network with other attendees. If not, then you can follow on the  live stream . The event is free, but please sign up on the event page . See you next week!

Statistics vs. Data Science vs. BI Like it? 712 comments 2 Posted May 17, 2013 Keywords : Data Scientist , Culture/Leadership , Big Data , Business Intelligence , Jobs , Statistics As someone who trained as a statistician, I've always struggled with that title. I love the rigor and insight that Statistics brings to data analysis, but let's face it: Statistics — the name — has always had a bit of a branding problem. Telling someone I was a statistician was more likely to conjure up images of me counting runs at a baseball (or cricket) game than pursuing serious science. And the image of what Statistics ideally is about —  collaborative, interactive, applied, fun — was too often subsumed by the stereotype  image — isolated, actuarial, ivory tower, report driven. (And hey, even actuaries can be fun sometimes.) That's why I'm a fan of the term \"data scientist\" — it embodies everything that Statistics always should be, without the baggage and tradition of the term \"statistician\". So I enjoyed participating in yesterday's Kalido webinar \" Data Scientist: Your Must-Have Business Investment Now \" where I could make the following contrast between the images of Statisticians and Data Scientists: (A quick aside on the \"Data Size\" row above: while the unstructured or unaggregated data source data that data scientist work with can be in the terabytes range or even large, by the time it's cleaned and prepared for statistical modeling, a file in the gigabytes range is even more typical — even at \"Big Data\" companies like Facebook . This is a topic I cover in more detail in my recent Strata talk on real-time predictive analytics .) So bottom line: while I am a statistician, and I love Statistics dearly, I do prefer to call myself a Data Scientist today, because it better represents to me what Statistics really is to me (if that makes sense). And that's certainly not to diminish the achievements of those who do call themselves Statistician. In particular, I want to recognize George Box : a true hero of mine, coiner of the idiom \"all models are wrong, but some are useful\", and one of the nicest people I ever met, who sadly passed away in March. On the other hand, I have no qualms about making a competitive comparison between Data Science and Business Intelligence: You can get the details of how I differentiate Statistics and Data Science and BI, and hear other perspectives on Data Science from fellow data scientists Carla Gentry and Gregory Piatetsky in the slide sand replay of the webinar provided by Kalido at the link below.

Delivering on this necessity in some cases is a cumbersome exercise – but it doesn’t have to be. We identified some key causes of cumbersome corporate reporting.   Ignoring the power of push down Some corporate centers have the tendency to assume overcentralized responsibilities. Whether it is related to bridging local accounting principles to group accounting principles, purchase price accounting, or cash flow statements, the idea that operating companies are unable to assume more responsibilities is counterproductive. Besides cluttering the process, this approach generally results in  multiple versions of the truth  – one truth as the operating company sees it, and another truth as the corporate center sees is. You can identify this if there are frequent debates about which are the ‘real’ figures.   The lost art of double-side bookkeeping Some people consider controlling, FP&A and reporting a superior activity compared to accounting, but at the same time they ignore the fact that the one depends on the other. Coherent and effective financial controlling, planning & analysis and reporting can only be achieved by relying on a solid journal entry basis. Corporate reporting sometimes fails to reflect that journal entry logic. The information then easily becomes incoherent. You can identify this if the indirect cash flow statement requires  too much manual adjustments to be completed .   Misaligned information architecture Each corporation’s information architecture consists of a suite of software solutions. ERP, CRM, BI and CPM (Corporate Performance Management) are widely adopted, but are often misaligned, limiting their potential. Being overly dependent on Excel for corporate reporting is a typical sign that CPM should be better positioned . Another example is when ERP is used for data collection or BI is used for financial consolidation. You can identify this if there is a general feeling that there is too much time and effort involved in submitting the required information.   The corporate reporting black hole Corporate reporting can be a one way street where information is pushed up the chain without a proper feedback loop. Such a situation is likely to exist in corporations that ignore the power of push down, but a missing feedback loop can be a broader problem. Reporting systems that do not provide the user immediate and automated feedback whether the information provided reconciles and makes sense also miss the feedback loop. A  well-designed feedback mechanism is one of the pillars of accurate and reliable reporting . You can identify this if it is possible to submit inaccurate or incomplete information without any red flags being raised.   High expectations but little guidance Delivering good corporate reporting requires a corresponding skillset. Understanding complexities around cash flow statements, organic growth, and business combinations is no small feat. Corporate centers generally expect the operating companies to deliver high quality information, but this is only feasible when there is a clear knowledge management strategy that incorporates user-oriented documentation and training. You can identify this quite easily by a lack of self-learning materials or by outdated documentation. Corporate reporting becomes cumbersome when the organizational, technological and social aspects are not sufficiently addressed. The corporate center should be aware of its role as competence center and process coordinator with regards to corporate reporting. With a well-designed and  value added Corporate Performance Management platform and reporting process in place , the corporate center can concentrate on teaching and coaching the operating companies. This requires a different skill set compared to the classical accounting-centric skills sought after in corporate centers. It is the combination of hard skills and soft skills that really makes the difference! I invite you to evaluate your corporate reporting process, keeping the above five causes in mind. Please reach out if you identified some of them.

When Does Cloud ERP Start Saving Money? Like it? 379 comment 1 Posted February 19, 2013 Keywords : big data , business intelligence , cloud , cloud erp , data in the cloud , it , software Companies that implement a cloud ERP solution are yielding significant and tangible cost reductions in both IT staff and hardware infrastructure, in addition to the intangible benefits of cloud solutions, such as access any time from anywhere from virtually any device. Because of such impressive benefits, the interest in cloud ERP is growing and installations are multiplying. However, to imply that organizations will find implementations to be a joyous and happy time, simply because of “the cloud,” is to set expectations that are nearly impossible to meet. That’s because a major component of an implementation that does not change is the ability of a company to absorb and learn new ERP software. Even cloud ERP requires dedicated time and documentation, sometimes an instructor, to train employees on the use of the new ERP software. Although some cloud ERP software vendors would like you to believe otherwise, just because it is in the cloud, doesn’t necessarily mean it is significantly easier to implement than On-Premise software. After all, the various aspects of implementing a cloud ERP solution versus an On-Premise system remain the same. There is the Analysis of the Business Requirements; and, sometimes, even more Business Process Re-Engineering. Users must be trained. The implementation encompasses the pilot of key functions, the conversion of data from the prior system (or Excel spreadsheets), and the various aspects of “customer go live on the ERP.” Nonetheless, with a cloud ERP implementation, a company does eliminate many of the hidden costs of implementing an On-Premise solution including the acquisition of hardware, operating system software, database management software and other infrastructure products. Not only do these items carry significant costs but come with built-in delays affecting the project. And, when all is said and done, the largest cost savings may be the ability to start and complete the entire implementation project without having to make that large up-front investment in perpetual license and maintenance fees that are characteristic of On-Premise solutions. With this said, though, there is still a learning curve, albeit one that most companies are prepared to handle. “Been there, done that!” For the most part, newer ERP software is easier to use – once you know how to use it! That’s the promise of each new addition of Windows too – but is this a reality? Yes, it is – once you know how to use it! However, no matter how it is sliced and diced, no matter how good a software system is documented, full-featured ERP software, Cloud or On-Premise, have complexities and nuances that take some time to understand and absorb. Bottom line – implementation efficiency is not gained because of “the cloud” or that the new software is promoted as “next generation.” Efficiency is gained because ERP is not a new concept and most companies have formerly undertaken ERP implementations. Their management and employees know the problems that occur during implementation and are now prepared to respond more quickly. They can compare and contrast what they are doing now versus what they did in the past. Today, they appreciate what is needed to implement an ERP: Commitment : The customer’s executives and management are committed to the implementation of the new software. Resources : Management allocates the proper amount of resources to assure success. Experience : The experience of the assigned implementation team can bring efficiencies and lessons learned from previous ERP implantation to the project. Right Partner : The company hires a software vendor that not only has truly figured out how to have all the functionality needed in the software but has actually made that software less complex and easier to turn on. Once their software is up, running and fully implemented, companies can even more appreciate the benefits of cloud ERP. Although they have cut infrastructure expenses from the very beginning, it’s at this point they really begin to appreciate the cost reductions in both IT staff and hardware infrastructure that only cloud ERP can provide, not to mention the intangibles that typically exceed expectations.

BI Case Study: Building an Open Data Portal Like it? 287 comment 1 Posted July 19, 2016 Keywords : Text Analytics , Workforce Analytics , Predictive Analytics , Web Analytics , Modeling , Business Intelligence This article was written by Paul Murphy, IT Program Leader at Co-operatives UK, about his experience using business intelligence technology to centralize years of messy historical data and create an open, explorable web portal. Do you have an interesting business intelligence case study to share? Email us at [email protected] . About one year ago today we decided it’s time to take statistical data that our organization has been gathering for over a century, and share it with the public through an open web portal. The results have been resoundingly successful, which is why I would like to share our story and demonstrate how open data can help you promote your organization and its goals. Why Open Data? Co-operatives UK – the network for Britain’s thousands of co-operative businesses, and a co-op itself – has, for over 100 years produced a variety of statistics on the co-operative sector. Behind these statistics is a large repository of data that we maintain on all co-operatives in the UK and their economic and social impact. However, until recently this valuable and unique source of intelligence was kept internal and not accessible to either our members or the public. Following a comprehensive review of our data strategy, a large data clean-up and investment in new systems, including BI analytics, we decided that we should start opening our data to the public. Many commercial enterprises would balk at the idea of sharing their data with the public. The tendency, particularly in private companies, is to treat data as either a well-kept trade secret, a private business asset, or some combination of both. However, as we subscribe to the same principles of openness, education and information that all co-ops subscribe to, for us it was a natural thing to do. Co-operatives UK (screenshot from web) Our aim was to enable co-ops to better work together by providing more information about which co-ops operate in which sectors of the economy and where they are. We also wanted to make it easier for researchers examining the social impact that co-operatives have on communities to get access to the data they need. Co-operatives have always been about improving society, so when we say that co-operatives do more to tackle gender inequality or that co-operatives are helping tackling tax avoidance , our Open Data initiative provides the evidence to back up these claims and allows researchers to independently verify that our stats are more than just PR. However, this was easier said than done, considering… You Need Clean Data If you’re going to make data publicly available, you’ll obviously need to provide it in a form that people can actually understand. Giving people access to mounds of raw data, with no governing principle, no single format and no way to easily explore is not likely to yield great results. In fact, this probably applies to any business intelligence initiative where you want people who aren’t IT professionals or data scientists to use data. To give you an idea of the complexity of the data we were dealing with in our case, you need to understand that Co-operatives come in many shapes and sizes: from sole trader, to charity, to PLC. This means there’s no single regulator for co-operative businesses and no single governed dataset detailing them. This in turn means that we had to aggregate data from dozens of sources, including regulators and government departments, company websites, and our own knowledge and research. As our data strategy evolved and capabilities grew, we learned to employ much more sophisticated data gathering techniques – such as automatic ingestion through APIs and screen scraping. We didn’t even know what data we had, let alone how to improve it. There were no schemata, lists or maps, just lots of disparate spreadsheets, systems and even post-it notes containing data. There was massive duplication, lack of shared understanding across teams and data quality was poor. We obviously needed to get the data to a state where we ourselves could make sense of it before making it publicly available. Improving Data Integrity is an Ongoing and often Arduous Process While not the primary focus of this article, this would be a good place to offer a word of advice: the amount of work you’ll need to put in to improve data quality depends on your organization and your data, but it’s as much about changing culture as it is about changing technology. You’ll need to spend time and effort getting cross-organisation agreement on the meaning of data, adoption of new systems and changing ways of working with and thinking about data. For us, the challenge was understanding the data assets we had, implementing an organisation-wide data structure and introducing completely new systems and processes. With systems and structures in place, we then set about the huge task of cleaning and rebasing our legacy data to increase its accuracy and coverage. However, it’s all worth it: Today, in addition to the Open Data Initiative, our organisation’s strategy is much more informed by data now and staff monitor its implementation with real-time dashboards. Decisions are more evidence-based. We’ve moved our data into Salesforce, which is our primary data platform, and maintain a few additional bespoke data systems, all MySQL based. Thankfully, the days of hundreds of spreadsheets of data are (mostly) behind us! Launching the Web Portal As in many data analytics projects, preparing the data was the hard part. After we made sense of our years of historical data, making it public was a pretty simple affair, and produced some exciting results. We give anyone interested the option to download the data in CSV format through our website. But while CSV files are great for researchers and data geeks like me, in order to engage our staff, members, the rest of the co-operative movement and the media, we needed something more visual. Ready-made infographics are one way that we present data for different audiences, and the interactive data visualization also played a crucial role: As part of the Open Data initiative we launched the Co-operative Data Explorer , which gives anyone visiting our website access to the data via interactive dashboards and data visualizations. People can filter the data or drill into specific time periods, or even specific co-ops, instantly and right on our website, in the way that is the most meaningful for them. This part of the project was fairly easy since we basically used a white-labeled version of Sisense for these embedded dashboards. Open Data Drives Trust, Traffic and Media Our Open Data initiative is less than a year old, but is already creating heaps of value for us. If previously the data was mostly ‘collecting dust’ in a mess of disparate systems, today it is used on a daily basis, and staff and members alike have that much more confidence in the statistics, research and media work we do. Open Data has enabled us to collaborate around data much more. A group of interested people have got together to explore how to further promote this collaboration ( http://www.p6data.coop ). We have held 2 hack-days so far with them, with some great ideas and prototypes in development. Media coverage of our Co-operative Economy report at the start of this month has been great, even with Brexit taking all the headlines. This infographic outlines some of the impact we’ve had just this month (click to enlarge):       Finally, looking at the web metrics for the data section of our website, including the dashboards, we can see visitors are coming in and are engaged – spending 3:27 minutes per page on average, which shows they are genuinely interested rather than just passing through.     About the Author Paul Murphy is a data scientist and the IT Program Leader at Co-operatives UK, where he leads the modernization and transformation of the organization’s IT infrastructure and business intelligence processes.

The Brady Law), there is currently no unified, national database of gun owners.   Without a Database, Establishing and Identifying Patterns from Data is Nearly Impossible   Federal and State agencies who take on the challenge of keeping us safe from terrorist attacks have to piece together data from a variety of sources. In corporate America, a data analyst would demand that a singular database be created in order to make data-mining a more efficient and reliable process.   Unfortunately, the Federal Government isn’t know for its efficiency. And, if it had the political will to create a registry, it would incur the wrath of the gun lobby in the United States. Protecting the rights of citizens is important, but demanding that only minimal tracking of firearms on a national level take place, we’re handicapping law enforcement and making the transfer of weapons to our enemies far easier.   How Would a National Database of Gun Owners Work?   To understand how a database could be successfully implemented, while still respecting the privacy of innocent individuals,  the legislators need to look no further than the current  System ID  infrastructure that is utilized in the private sector. At the point of manufacture, firearm producers can barcode their devices and register them in the database.    While firearms currently have serial numbers etched into them, this information is only rarely entered into comprehensive databases that track the weapon from manufacturer to vendor and finally to consumer. Having a unified System ID infrastructure would allow for law enforcement to keep track of registered events involving a specific firearm (i.e. manufacture, purchase and sale).   Online, Accessible and Efficient   By providing gun owners the ability to register their firearms online and then self-report sales (including identifying information of the new owners), a national database could be maintained. Will it be perfect? No, there will always be a degree of data-loss as unreported transactions take place. But, having a good- faith effort to track weapons and the purchase of weapons would provide law enforcement and their data analysts the ability to better understand the threat-vector; hopefully preventing a large number of future terrorist events.

The Future of Cloud Computing Like it? 549 comments 0 Posted January 6, 2016   What’s driving the adoption of cloud computing models? To find out, Trillium chose to co-sponsor the fifth annual Future of Cloud Computing Survey conducted by North Bridge, a leading venture capital firm, and Wikibon, an open source community of industry analysts. The survey results were released in mid-December by way of a press release and a webinar conducted by both organizations. As the industry’s largest independent survey of cloud adoption trends, the results are an insightful snapshot of what is happening in the cloud market. And, given initiative like Trillium Cloud, as well as our integration with cloud solutions like Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics CRM, the survey is of considerable interest to Trillium and our customers. Some noteworthy results include: The respondents reported that the systems with which they engage with their prospects and customers are now dominated by cloud deployment approaches. Almost 82% of sales and marketing systems and 79% of customer service systems are using cloud approaches. 80% of the respondents are doing business analytics via cloud approaches. It might be easy to conclude from the above that these are continuing signals of the LOB using cloud solutions as a way to execute end-arounds of enterprise IT, but the survey also references a “reemergence of IT’s use of cloud”, which the survey analysis concludes is an indicator of the “normalization of cloud.” Why that reemergence? Likely because agility is increasingly a motivator for cloud adoption and IT recognizes that the traditional on-premise deployments are a legacy that may not survive if business is to keep pace with modern demands. The embrace of cloud by IT may be a ‘get on board or get out of the way’ response to the need to be more quick and agile with solution development and deployment. How quick and agile? According to the survey, respondents want their systems to be delivering value within three months. That expectation is one of the reasons that solutions like Trillium Cloud are focused on “time to value” as an important metric for our customers. Though Trillium’s commitment is to begin delivering value in 30 days, not three months. The survey also notes that organizations are using the cloud solutions to try to wring more value from their data through real-time analysis and operations. But there are challenges, as concerns about security, and privacy remain (for approximately one third of the respondents.) Being open to such concerns is one reason that Trillium has chosen not to be prescriptive about our cloud solution. Our customers can choose on-premise or cloud deployments in a solution-agnostic way. Same solution, same prospective results in terms of improvement of data quality – but we leave the deployment choice to our customers. There are lots more to be found in the survey results, of course, but technology surveys are a bit like presidential polls in that they’re open to different interpretations. So readers are encouraged to check out the survey for themselves and see where their organization fits on the cloud adoption spectrum. You won’t find anything as brash as The Donald or as provocative as Bernie, but there’s lots of interesting information to be found. by Chris Martins, Product Marketing Manager, Trillium Software Login or register to post comments Feed: TRILLIUM SOFTWARE INSIGHTS Original article stay informed Get a daily email with the latest news about IT strategy, infrastructure, software, security, big data, and more.

Data Management for Better Business in the New Age Like it? 272 comments 0 Posted February 23, 2013 Keywords : Best Practices , Knowledge Management , Big Data , IT , Software , Business Intelligence , Collaborative Data , Data Management Within any business, particularly large enterprises, data management is a crucial player in the success of the operation. In a business model, information is the equivalent of blood flow in the human body, and must be regulated very efficiently. For companies that sell or trade a product, data management is vital. If information is not organized in a way that makes operations smoother, the business will suffer immediately. Below I have listed ways that a business can transform data management with the goal of improving business execution. 1. Recycle the paper. There is no need to continue the use of shipment forms or other paper documents when filing information. It’s a sad reality, but it’s time to put away the clip board and grab the Ipad. Business data management in 2013 should be based around the advanced IT and data management systems that are available. All shipping documents, client portfolios and stock inventory should be kept within a centralized data server, whether it is a mainframe computer system or an outsourced cloud service. All documentation should be made and monitored electronically. While human error will still be an issue that needs to be accounted for, it will be systematically easier to troubleshoot and locate crucial material if everything is documented within a centralized IT system. This idea is based around increasing automation within data management, but maintaining a fundamental level of human oversight. 2. Cross train employees. With the amount of information circling the business world in 2013, all employees need to be trained outside of their daily job role. Within an IT department and data management team specifically, a business needs to utilize the employees in unique ways. For instance, the data modeler within the department should present the conclusions to both the IT group and the general business leaders after analyzing the data. This ties everyone together and makes the results more universally applicable. It also helps employees better understand where their role fits in to the overall business model. The days of having Employee A troubleshoot the internet exclusively while on the clock are fading on the horizon. It’s time to train employees to the level of being able to move laterally and vertically within the company arrangement. The more skills an employee acquires through training or experience only increases their inherent value to the company. 3. Consolidate data software. If a business has one software provider for the payroll system and one for the business inventory, there is no reason that in 2013 both sectors cannot be satisfied through one provider. There are several reasons that the consolidation of software is useful, but the main reason is that employee training is much easier for data management and business leaders. If the same applications are being used across roles in the same department, the uniformity will grow exponentially. If the employees managing the payroll batch processing can also maintain the weekly processing of shipping data, two positions are fused into one. The employee or position that is left out of the equation can then be utilized elsewhere in the organization. Uniform and consolidated software agreements lead to reliability within a company. A business that has three separate software providers for different company operations only leads to confusion down the road. A business in 2013 can grow more rapidly if data management works in unison with each and every system under its watch.  Data management is the engine that drives commerce, and in 2013 this sector of business is more important than ever before. Whether it is inventory or payroll, the data management leadership needs to focus on making employees and software cross-applicable within the entire scope of the business model.

New Social collaboration tools have been created and they have been very helpful with knowledge management. One example is a question and answer platform that is specific to businesses. Senexx(www.senexx.com) is one example of a quesiton and answer platform. This platform helps workers collaborate better with each other. Thus, this software helps companies better manage and utilize their knwoledge.  Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Please note: Your first comment as a registered user will be held for moderation up to 24 hours (usually less).

Big Data and Rise of Predictive Enterprise Solutions Like it? 349 comments 2 Posted February 11, 2012 Keywords : big data , erp , CRM , Predictive Analytics Given the three Vs of Big Data, namely Volume, Variety and Velocity (read this for more ) , challenge before large and medium sized companies is how to unlock the potential of Big Data and productively leverage its value in running the business. In “traditional” Data Analytics or Business Intelligence, focus is more on analysis and reporting of “historic” or past data stored in the database. Take for example how most organizations use data from their CRM or ERP applications. Almost all the reports that are generated pertain to past or “historic” information. Running a business based on “historic” or past data is like driving a car looking in the rear view mirror and is not going to work. Instead, companies must analyze all the available information in real time, apply statistical modeling techniques to available information in order to predict future outcomes and take action/run the business based on predicted outcome rather than analysis of historic data as is being done currently. Since Big Data is characterized by not only Volume, but also Velocity and Variety, it is very important that Big Data is used for analysis in real-time to predict the future and take corrective action based on that analysis. How about using Causal Path analysis on Social Media data (like Twitter and Facebook) to predict Churn or Customer Attrition in Telecom industry and taking corrective action to prevent Churn/Attrition rather than analyzing “historic” attrition rate, call volumes or average response time as being done currently. The real value is in using predictive analytics and taking corrective action before it is too late, rather than just reporting historical information. Techniques like Multiple-regression analysis coupled with Factor analysis, Cluster analysis and Causal Path analysis can be used very effectively with Big data – now that we have many variables and multiple observation for each variable at a customer level to generate statistically significant difference in analysis. In future, no ERP or CRM system will be complete without Predictive Analytics functionality that will enable companies take preventive steps (rather than reactive) in real time. For example, rather than analyzing “historic” attrition rates, Predictive CRM application will make it possible for companies to identify critical incidents leading to customer attrition so that steps can be taken to retain the customer before he/she defects. And thanks to Predictive Analytics, ERP or CRM applications will no longer be just a repository of “historical” information but will be transformed into a Predictive Knowledge base or Engine driving business decisions looking forward and not backwards/in the rear view mirror of “historic” information.

And also, thanks for pointing out that the popular 3Vs of Big data originated over 11 years ago. I, like many of the readers of this blog, was not aware of it. Thanks for pointing it out and I appreciate your thought-leadership on the subject.

Changing Environment is Changing Analytics Like it? 104 comment 1 Posted October 6, 2011 Keywords : Role of the Analyst , Best Practices , Culture/Leadership Looking back across the last ten years working with analysts in a variety of industries, I realize how much has changed in the environment. As with any evolutionary process, this change in the environment means analysts have had to adapt accordingly. Three changes in my mind have had the biggest impact. More data! Despite the increased strategic importance of analysts, there is a lot more data to contend with. Like doctors who loathe the internet due to the increased time they must spend un-diagnosing for their patients what a clever online algorithm proclaimed, analysts must fend off misinterpretations of myriad data points brought to them by those perhaps unaware of the pitfalls of a lack of research rigor. Data is now everywhere, in various formats, of various types. This provides analysts with much more data with which to create their stories, and it doesn’t always line up. This can be paralyzing for the perfectionist trying to back up every implications or forces analysts to put some value on their inclination which is not something condoned by the industry accepted analyst personae. This glut of data also has a lot of analysts tied up in complex integration projects that continuously chase a moving target and don’t represent what analysts love to do, which is draw mighty implications that change the world (or at least the department). However, analysts complained for decades they wanted more data, so perhaps a lesson in being careful what you wish for.  Today’s analysts don’t want data, but more tools to consolidate and integrate to make interpretation simpler and faster, due to the next point. Less time! Whereas it is debatable whether some data needs to be real-time, it is a cool marketing stamp that data suppliers love, so real-time data is growing in volume. Consequently, real-time implications are becoming expected. Systems to create real-time data are rampant, but systems to process and interpret them have not quite caught up. Not so long ago, analysts could spend months as part of the strategic planning cycle making sure their implications and recommendations were thought through, reviewed, stakeholder approved, and even polished for beautiful presentation by artistic graphic artists. Today, yesterday’s results require interpretation today so implications can be presented tomorrow and action plans can be executed by end of week. Statistical models are flourishing, algorithms are flooding, and sexy BI tools are growing in the market, but they are still trying to catch up with all the data.  And like all wonder drugs, they seem to come with that warning to check with your analyst first before believing all the automated conclusions. More importance! You will hear everywhere that corporations are putting more of a focus on fact-based decision making. This nomenclature must be anathema to the ageing baby boomer, making it seem like decisions back in the day were based on gut and emotions. However, there is an increased expectation that decisions be defended with rigorous metrics and that all goals and objectives have clear measures attached to them that must be monitored often. This dramatically increases the power of the owner and manipulator of the data (the analyst), who is the expert at assembling the data into an implication that ideally drives action. Overall the opportunities for analysts to influence important decisions are growing. And what every analyst wants is to influence decisions based on sound interpretation of solid data.  Analysts can now find themselves in the middle of the big show, often holding the balance of power by being the owner and interpreter of the facts.  But like dynamic orators skilled in the art of rhetoric back in the first senates, all analysts know that the selection and presentation of the data can easily lead to many different conclusions based on what is chosen to show or not show. With great power comes great responsibility. The opportunities are better than ever, but a need to stay objective, as unbiased as we can, and to consider all strong challenges is paramount.  We must be ready for the hard debates and not become that expert witness ready to defend any point for a fee.

Designing the Ultimate Business Intelligence Tool Like it? 374 comments 2 Posted November 28, 2011 Keywords : API , BI Issues , bi tools , Best Practices , Business Intelligence A short time ago I was contacted regarding a blog by Jaime Brugueras , discussing what he feels is lacking in the current crop of Business Intelligence (BI) tools. I was asked to provide my feedback via blog post and hopefully start up a discussion. Everything which Brugueras describes in his blog would comprise the ultimate BI tool. He clearly highlights key pain points felt by all levels of user and creates the framework by which these could be addressed. In spite of his observations, I feel that the nature of the market and current BI tool landscape prevents these recommendations from being realized. The core argument of Brugueras’ blog can be summed up as follows: Business Intelligence tools need to be easier to use, more comprehensive in nature, predictive of future outcomes and cheap enough that even the smallest businesses can afford it. He goes on to advocate for tools that are more sophisticated than a team of IT professionals could program, but simple enough for a lay person to configure. He notes that “tools available today are relatively complex and require some level of programming”, yet a few lines later declares that “an effective BI tool allows for seamless integration of data across… CRM, accounting and point-of-sale software”. He laments, however, that current BI tools are “unable to integrate data from all sources”. While multiple tools may output into similarly-formatted CSV files, the database from where these exports originate don’t all have the same schema. There exists no universal key to link multiple data sources, and few companies are willing turn themselves into information providers by facilitating others usage of their data. Many would rebut my previous statement by calling my attention to APIs ; how companies like Google, foursquare and Twitter make their data available to the outside world. They would be correct, save for one key point: the user accommodates, as opposed to dictates, the format of the API. If you don’t like how Twitter has named a particular variable, then too bad for you. A company like Google isn’t going to change their data structure simply because you ask nicely. When you consider that every company out there has their own special flavor of API, the dream of “an effective BI tool (that) allows for seamless integration of data” simply goes up in smoke. Every time a provider comes along, you will either need to adapt your BI tool to accept their data, or ask them to conform to your standard. The former is far more likely than the latter, but doing the former requires programmers and programmers cost money. It is not difficult to see the relationship between cost and compatibility. Being more compatible requires a larger programmer base, which in turn requires more capital. The resulting tool would have to be heavily ad-supported, or sell at a price point sufficient to cover ongoing development costs. Very quickly you enter into the realm of enterprise-level solutions, where even the traditionally free Google Analytics has started charging $150,000/year for a Premium service level. This price point is clearly far outside the realm of affordability for the majority of small businesses. The author advocates for an all encompassing, low-cost solution aimed at the SMB market. He wants a tool that is user friendly, inexpensive and easy to use, featuring automatic integration with multiple data sources that is predictive of future outcomes. He acknowledges that end-users “are not likely to be able to program their needs”, yet advocates the development of modular software in anticipation of every possible need. These BI tools must be action oriented, distilling complicated tasks like customer retention, inventory management and social media communication down to the simple click of a button. While wonderful in concept, I don’t believe that all will ever be within a single tool. Apple products, be it the iPhone, iPad or iPod, are famous for working well together. Apple accomplishes this by controlling every step of the process, and knowing exactly what goes into every piece of hardware. They can then perfectly tailor their software to work within the hardware’s specifications, producing a very attractive product offering. However, a Mac falls flat when trying to run software originally written for a PC. With Apple reticent to license out their iOS to third party developers, don’t expect to see this product-line unity augmented or replicated anytime soon. There are only two ways that Brugueras’ ideal BI tool could come to pass: A unifying open-source project of unprecedented scope or one single (for profit) company willing to take users cradle-to-grave for all their business software needs. While I don’t think that a massive open-source project could appear, I make a point to never say never. The cynic in me just doesn’t see it, though. A single company creating a full-feature, A-to-Z Business Intelligence tool isn’t very likely, either. The barrier to entry isn’t so high that somebody wouldn’t try and come up with a “me too” product offering. I’m not here to preach about what my ideal Business Intelligence tool would be, because I don’t believe that there can ever be a one-size-fits-all tool. You’ll never get enterprise-level features in a cheap/free product, either because of the associated development costs or due to the simple inability for small businesses to devote the required time to such a far reaching tool. Take your prototypical small business as an example, where employees generally wear more than one hat. It’s likely that your “web guy” will not only be responsible for website design and SEO, but also for PPC and SEM and possibly copy writing for both the online channel and traditional corporate communications. Ask yourself, will this overworked individual be able to devote the time required to use a highly-sophisticated BI tool? Much like clothing, creating something that is one-size-fits-all typically results in a garment which is a poor fit for 99% of the population. When you buy a suit, most people require that the pants be hemmed or the jacket taken in. Few people are truly “off the rack”, so why do we expect the same from our BI tools? There exist tools that work very well for small business, which scale well and can accommodate the business as it grows. They don’t have the features of an enterprise-level tool, but small businesses don’t have the bandwidth to use all those features anyway. Rather than devote time to chasing the dream of the perfect tool, end-users should focus on better expressing their BI tool needs. The corporate world has been quite successful at recognizing needs and designing products to meet them. I have every confidence that several different vendors will step up and provide targeted solutions, provided the requirements are clear and properly documented by the eventual end-users.

Companies often have a mishmash of Various application providers which sometime have their own proprietary data stores ect > which often export key data to CSV when required.   The missing link here is an intelligent BI solution that removes the need for high level technical knowledge to enable accurate / useful reporting. On my travels I have coma across a number of solutions which try to do this ( the most recent being ZAPBI ) , but where they succeed in usability they fail in accuracy.   I believ that this situation will evolve as Databases and indeed database design becomes more standardised accross the board so that BI systems can be easily implemnted and maintained by business users and without the need or involvelemnt of some sort of High level technical resource.   Although open to discussion, I would be interested to hear of over experiences.. in the real working or implementation environment Overallit - 0207 183 4453 www.overall-it.co.uk Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Like it? 354 December 1, 2011 A guest says: As per the core argument of Brugueras’ blog Business Intelligence tools need to be easier to use, more comprehensive in nature, predictive of future outcomes and cheap enough that even the smallest businesses can afford it.

The ideal BI tool will serve a specific target and serve a specific need. Already the big vendors like IBM and SAS do provide solutions targeted for inventory management, marketing, social media, and performance management. Many smaller vendors do as well. You did mention this, and I'm glad you did \"several different vendors will step up and provide targeted solutions\". When you provide a targeted solution, you can specifically leverage the API of the leading platforms that industry serves. Then you can have pre-built analytics that serve that industry and need. Now the SMB can use 3 or 4 solutions that take care of all the analytics they need across their business.

Forrester’s Customer Experience Forum 2012 Like it? 147 comments 0 Posted May 11, 2012 Keywords : Sentiment Analytics , Best Practices , Market Research , CRM , Data Mining For decades, companies have been paying lip service to the idea of delighting customers, while disappointing them in every channel. That tactic won’t cut it anymore. Why not? We’ve entered a new era that Forrester calls the age of the customer — a time when customer experience matters more than any other strategic imperative. For most companies, customer experience is the single greatest predictor of whether they’ll get another purchase from their customers — or see them defect to a competitor.  It’s so critical that even virtual monopolies like cable providers and health insurers suffer when they fail at it. Customer experience goes to the heart of everything you do — the value you provide, how you conduct business, and the way your people behave when they interact with customers and each other. You can’t afford to ignore it because your customers take it personally each and every time they touch your products, your services, and your support. This year, Forrester’s Customer Experience Forum will feature case studies, data, business models, and tools from its upcoming book, Outside In: The Power of Putting Customers at the Center of Your Business . It will show you how leaders in industries like financial services, retail, media, and telecommunications take control of the factors that make or break customer experience at their organizations with tools including ecosystem maps and the six disciplines of customer experience. In addition to its outstanding industry guests, it will deliver consumer data, analysis, one-on-one meetings with Forrester analysts, plus peer networking. These will give you the actionable insights needed to transform your company so that you can reap the full business benefits of the customer experience revolution.

On the Move: Surveying your Mobile User Like it? 121 comments 0 Posted July 11, 2012 Keywords : Mobility , Market Research , Data Mining , IT Increasingly, people are using mobile platforms for online activities – like shopping, reading, playing games and communicating on social networks. But when people use mobile devices, they exhibit characteristics and behaviors that differ from their desktop counterparts. As mobile usage continues to grow, it’s becoming critical to understand the mobile customers’ experiences, intentions and desires.  Here are 3 tips for creating an effective mobile survey that will give your mobile customers a voice. 1.  Realize time is precious While the tasks that a mobile user does online may be as diverse as those done on the desktop, one ubiquitous characteristic of mobile is ‘time’. Mobile sessions are considerably shorter and mobile users are far more task oriented. With time at a premium, respondent fatigue occurs faster and survey abandonment times are significantly shorter on the mobile platform than on the traditional ones. Keep surveys short and to the point, placing the most critical questions right up front. Don’t ask your user for more than one open-ended response, either: Typing long or detailed answers on a mobile keypad will cause exponential drop-off, and those that do complete may provide lower-quality answers later in the survey. 2. Optimize for the mobile form factor Mobile users with larger screens generally prefer to use the ‘full’ version of the site as opposed to the mobile version. Phone-sized screens should be the researcher’s primary focus (not tablets), optimizing both the invitation and the survey itself for these smaller resolutions. Survey invitations should only occupy a portion of the screen to avoid being regarded as advertisements, and the invitation text should be reduced to a single sentence. If you use a second stage to your invitation, make sure that the trigger (icon, overlay, etc) doesn’t obstruct the website. The way people answer questions should be considered as well. Rating questions with complicated or long scales should be avoided, as should ranking questions (“place these items in order of…”). Single or multi-select questions are best, as they are quick to answer and less likely to fatigue your respondents. 3. Ask mobile specific questions Don’t waste your mobile user face time by asking questions you already have millions of data points for.  While important, a mobile survey is not the medium from which to build detailed personas. General demographic data is something most companies have in spades, so unless a particular demographic criteria is essential for segmenting this specific piece of research, best to leave it out. Ask questions that directly relate to the mobile experience, whether it’s mobile behavior or website feedback. Ask direct questions and keep the wording simple. “ How would you rate your experience today ” is much more effective than “ Using the following 0-10 scale, please indicate how you would rate your overall website experience today. ” Following the above steps will help you create a successful mobile survey. You are your survey’s best judge, however, so if you find the survey too long or ‘ugly,’ chances are your mobile user will as well.

Why Every Big Data Team Should Have an Independent Auditor Like it? 133 comments 0 Posted June 9, 2016 Keywords : Big Data Data engineers, data scientists, solution architects and system administrators are the integral parts of any data science team, but do we really need an independent auditor for a Big Data project? If the experts are to be believed, then an IT auditor can play an important role in the success of any Big Data project. If you are yet to utilize the services of an independent auditor for the quality assurance purpose, then it is likely that you are missing out on quality-specific insights that only an auditor can provide. Let's find out the key benefits of having an independent auditor in the governance of Big Data and Data Science teams. 1. Performs the Controlling Function The main responsibility of the auditor is to perform the controlling function, which is a part of the overall project management function. It's the auditor who makes sure that the policies and processes are being adhered to. 2. Ensures the Expected Quality Standard It is the duty of the auditor to ensure that the quality standards are either met or exceeded. Besides determining the audit scope and objectives, the auditor is also entrusted with the responsibility to come up with quality guidelines and checklists. Having an independent auditor, who is not directly reporting to the project manager, ensures that periodic audits are being conducted to measure the effectiveness of predefined quality guidelines. 3. Resolves Conflict of Interest Resolving any conflict of interest in the team can be another area where an auditor can step into. For example, when the project managers are under pressure to deliver results within strict deadlines, it's a common practice to take shortcuts through the quality process. An IT auditor can keep the project manager honest in such a scenario. 4. Serves As a Bridge between Leadership and Project Team The organization's leadership can have certain expectations, while the project management team can have expectations of their own. Sometimes the differences get lost due to the lack of direct communications. Such expectation mismatches can have devastating affects, including but not limited to project failures. Having an independent auditor in the team, who would interact regularly with both the project team as well as the leadership, helps both the parties to align their thoughts according to the business requirements. 5. Helps in Decision Making Process Well-crafted audit reports that include result-based insights and recommendations can immensely help in the organization's decision-making process. That's another strong reason why you should invest in hiring a qualified IT auditor for your Big Data team. Final Thoughts: To sum things up, modern-day enterprises handling Big Data initiatives should ideally have an independent audit team that functions seamlessly alongside the data team. The role that an auditor play in the governance of a data science project is unique and critical. It helps the team to maintain the desired level of output quality by strictly enforcing project governance - where all the parties, including the organizational leadership, team members and the project managers, are tied together by a single controlling thread in the form of an auditor.

First Look – Oracle Data Mining Update Like it? 272 comment 1 Posted August 4, 2011 Keywords : oracle , Data Mining , Predictive Analytics , Business Intelligence I got an update from Oracle on Oracle Data Mining (ODM) recently. ODM is an in-database data mining and predictive analytics engine that allows you to build and use advanced predictive analytic models on data that can be accessed through your Oracle data infrastructure. I blogged about ODM extensively last year in this First Look – Oracle Data Mining and since then they have released ODM 11.2. The fundamental architecture has not changed, of course. ODM remains a “database-out” solution surfaced through SQL and PL-SQL APIs and executing in the database. It has the 12 algorithms and 50+ statistical functions I discussed before and model building and scoring are both done in-database. Oracle Text functions are integrated to allow text mining algorithms to take advantage of them.  Additionally, because ODM mines star schema data it can handle an unlimited number of input attributes, transactional data and unstructured data such as CLOBs, tables or views. This release takes the preview GUI I discussed last time and officially releases it. This new GUI is an extension to SQL Developer 3.0 (which is available for free and downloaded by millions of SQL/database people). The “Classic” interface (wizard-based access to the APIs) is still available but the new interface is much more in line with the state of the art as far as analytic tools go. The GUI allows you to manage database Connections within which there are Projects that in turn contain Workflows. These look very much like those in SAS Enterprise Miner or IBM SPSS Modeler with a variety of action nodes that can be linked into a data mining flow. Workflows have immediate access to the database with tables, joins, views as well as to remote data being managed through the Oracle Database. Other nodes include those to create views, explore data, merge and clean data, transform and aggregate data, create models etc. A filter node allows you to take out noisy data elements, attributes that aren’t important, sample data and more. All the statistics needed by the analysis and reporting nodes are run inside the database too and all the steps in the workflow produce SQL breadcrumbs. Nodes like Classification run multiple models at the same time and allow defaults to be overridden to play with different modeling approaches. There are also some power user features to allow tweaking of parameters. The user can select one or more models to push on through the workflow. Once a model is ready it can be applied to a database table or embedded in the database as a live column. With Exadata models are pushed to the storage level for execution for maximum performance. The extension includes help for data miners to use the tool plus training “Cue Cards” and sample data as well as an embedded “infomercial” to introduce data mining concepts to DBAs and others who might come across it while using SQL Developer. There are also an increasing number of training classes available online. One of the most interesting facts about ODM remains its use in other Oracle solutions. As noted previously it is being embedded in various applications – from Fusion Human Capital Management to Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE). There is also some ongoing work with Oracle Real Time Decisions (RTD) – see my review of the most recent version of RTD . This plus sharing the BI sales team is increasing take up and broadening the reach of ODM both within Oracle and its customer base. In-database analytics is a hot topic these days and the ability of ODM to build and execute models completely in-database makes it a good candidate for anyone interested in using predictive analytics to make the most of the operational data they have.

The Internet of Things Is Moving from Science Fiction to Science Fact Like it? 240 comments 0 Posted May 14, 2015 Keywords : Analytics Increased connectivity, smart homes, wearable watches and innovative connected devices are quickly changing the way we think, function and live. The \"things\" consist of a panoply of devices that provide a perceived value or service to consumers. The devices are intuitive, functional and provide a practical function. The IoT is not some far-fetched, future reality that has yet to be realized. Far from it, connected devices that make up the Internet of Things outnumbers the population of the world by 3 to 2. The rise of the Internet of Things makes life easier for consumers, but will also require advanced threat defense strategies to protect consumers from data theft and other invasions of privacy using aggressive measures including advanced threat de fense . Each \"thing\" has a uniquely identifiable code or frequency that is able to work within the Internet's existing infrastructure. Consumer IoT devices include smart watches, automobile sensors, smart floors that respond to environmental conditions, fitness tracking devices and alarm clocks that gently wake you during the lightest part of your sleep cycle. The Internet of Things has the potential to make life easier and help people get more done with their day. The growth of IoT technology is largely attributed to the growth of cloud computing, increased analytics capabilities, increasing connectivity of machines and networks. Microsoft's Bi working on Hadoop is a prime example of cloud computing and integration putting big data into the hands of small businesses and doing it affordably. The barrier to entry for big data has never been lower. Which is allowing the spread of applications that connect customers and manufacturers in ways never before imagined. The Future of Information The opportunities presented by big data are enormous, and consumers are likely to find that the privacy concerns over big data give way to the additional convenience and promise of a better quality of life. Consumers that have had trouble taking charge of their health in the past can now use integrated watches that automatically track movements, calories burned and daily caloric intake. Smart apps connected to these wearable devices make use of bar code scanning to quickly enter in nutritional information for an astonishing collection of user-submitted nutritional data. This allows consumers to more easily track their eating habits, make smarter choices and ensure they are getting the right nutrients to operate at their peak efficiency. On the other hand, it fuels the data-driven marketing surge that is a result of the growing amounts of consumer data. This has allowed marketers to narrow their pitch to each specific person they get information on. Wearable technology and other connected devices are literally everywhere. They can be found proudly clinging to the joggers wrist, adorning shoes, hanging from your phone and wrapped up in your life. Devices are continually counting calories, steps, heart rate, helping to manage your golf swing, and collecting data about the way you move and operate on a daily basis. One of the concerns with this technology has been battery life. As these devices are used throughout the day, solar-powered smart watches such as the Nevo Solar and the UVN Shake are beginning to make their mark on the world. The typical scenario for a bit of wearable technology involves a set-it-and-forget-it approach to technology, where you input your preferences and let the device gather data and work in the background while you go about your day. A typical fitness tracker may keep track of your steps and report how many calories you burned at the end of the day. This sort of upkeep allows you to better manage your health by knowing exactly how many calories you need to consume to lose or maintain your weight. Making Sense of Big Data on a Micro Level The main problem with this sort of information is that it doesn't provide any data that a consumer can readily act upon. In order to understand the figures reported, you need to take that information and apply it in a practical way. For wearable technology to catch on and truly benefit consumers, the tech needs to go beyond information gathering and provide real, practical solutions based on the collected data. The name of the game in wearable tech is how well the data is going to empower consumers to get more out of their life once the data collection stage is complete. A dizzying array of wearable devices are coming out on the market, including devices that automatically record conversations, sleep monitors and reminders to complete your tasks for the day. New categories of data are being created as a direct result of wearable tech. Nutritional information used to be something you would have to get from the food manufacturer. Now, individuals are processing and updating their data by scanning foods they eat regularly into large databases. Those interested in living a polyphasic sleep schedule can set their alarms to wake them after a single sleep cycle, and wake them at a point where they are least likely to be groggy. This information is determined based on data that is collected when an individual wakes. By simply stating whether you feel rested, neutral or tired, the app can send collected data to the developer to further improve their products. With all the advantages that wearable data poses, there are certainly certain risks involved as well. Companies will need to take an advance threat defense approach to employees that wear their connected devices to work. Devices may compromise security by transferring plain text information over an unsecured Bluetooth connection. Documents may be taken from the office by an unwitting employee who wants to get more work done at home. Security experts warn that the data collected by these devices can't always be guaranteed to end up in the right hands. Passwords stored on wearable tech can be accessed by increasingly tech-savvy thieves. Data can be used for unauthorized purposes, and disgruntled employees may compromise a network using a carefully programmed app. Maintaining Transparency Symantec, a leading tech security firm, ran an analysis of several different wearable devices. Each device was determined to be 100 percent trackable, and many of the tracking apps transmitted personally identifiable unencrypted data, including email, names, addresses and passwords. This puts consumers at increased risk for identity theft, profiling, extortion and stalking. Some employees worry that a generous corporate gift of wearable technology could turn into a way to track worker productivity. As the Federal Trade Commission pushes for increased transparency in the world of big data, it's important for consumers to learn to protect themselves. Big data often sells information about consumers without their explicit knowledge. The consent for this misuse is usually located deep within the terms and conditions of use that most people readily discard. The world of wearable tech has the ability to change lives, but it's not all roses as one downside is the ability for marketers to tailor ads to users based on their activities. More sinister uses include the ability for a thief to gain access to a person's daily activities and plan the best time to steal or break into a house. As with all new technology, consumers must stay alert, aware and abreast of their rights, risks and responsibilities to stay safe and use new technology wisely. Simply clearing your device nightly and storing the data on your computer can help improve your safety and security.

Big Data Gets a Budget Boost, But How Can It Help Your Business? Like it? 477 comments 0 Posted March 21, 2014 Keywords : Big Data Big data is a big deal – so much so that Chancellor George Osborne announced plans for a centre dedicated to it in this week’s Budget speech. Named after the pioneering code breaker Alan Turing, the Alan Turing Institute will focus on further innovation in big data research. Big data is loosely described as the collecting, organising and analysing of large volumes of data. The new institute will see the Government invest £42 million over the next five years into big data research. But how can big data help your business get ahead? The government says big data “can allow businesses to enhance their manufacturing processes, target their marketing better, and provide more efficient services”. Unprecedented ability to analyse The Government’s claims about the business benefits of big data are backed up by independent tech analyst  Steve Nimmons . He says big data offers firms an “unprecedented ability to analyse business data”. Deal with soaring customer expectations The saying ‘customer is king’ has never been so relevant. The white heat technological revolution of  mobile  and social media has seen customer expectations soar – and also given them a platform to complain when those expectations are not met. So analysing data about your customers can deliver key insights to help ensure their expectations are met. Nimmons explains: “Customers are technically savvy and ever-more demanding. They expect businesses to treat them as individuals, not as customer segments and respond to their needs at speed.” Get to know your customers A recent  survey by IBM  found 80% of CEOs believe they deliver a superior customer experience, while just 8% of their customers agree. This is where big data analytics come in. By analysing this data you can learn invaluable information about your customers, which in turn will help you understand what they want and how they want it. Nimmons explains: “Big Data helps you understand customers at greater depth, take the temperature of customer sentiments and scan for emerging opportunities and disruptive business models.” Commit to big data to get ahead of your rivals A  study from Forbes  found that firms making good use of big data were seeing benefits, while those that aren’t were less likely to achieve their aims. The survey of 211 senior marketers found 60% of firms that used big data for at least 50% of their marketing campaigns had exceeded their targets. However, this dropped to just a third for firms that used the technique in less than half of campaigns. Meanwhile nearly three-quarters of firms using big data for more than half could pinpoint their target audience in all or most media activities – twice as much as those in the less than 50% group. The statistics show that firms showing a commitment to big data analytics are gaining competitive advantage over those that are not. As Nimmons concludes: “In short, Big Data is a must have weapon in the information race. Get ahead of your competitors and get on a level playing field with your customers. If either have better information and technology than you, your days could be numbered.” The Alan Turing Institute A hugely influential logician and computer scientists, Bletchley Park code breaker Alan Turing was crucial to breaking German ciphers during World War 2. In his Budget speech, George Osborne said: “We will found the Alan Turing Institute to ensure Britain leads the way again in the use of big data and algorithm research. I am determined that our country is going to out-compete, out-smart and out-do the rest of the world.” Login or register to post comments Feed: Insight UK Blog Original article Connect: Authored by: Jon Smith Jon Smith is an EMEA e-Marketing Specialist for Insight UK a leading provider of hardware, software and services.

How to Get Started in the Cloud Like it? 267 comments 0 Posted May 26, 2014 Keywords : Cloud Computing   Cloud computing  has progressed from a niche buzzword to a business essential in recent years. But if you’re still lagging behind what’s the easiest way to get started? In this guide you’ll find some expert advice on taking your first steps to cloud migration. Minimise risk by taking baby steps Though you may be suitably seduced enough by the cloud to want to migrate in one fell swoop, experts advise a more graduated approach. First ask yourself ‘what should we put in the cloud?’ Your answer should be driven in the early stages by minimising risk. Doug Clark, IBM UK and Ireland cloud leader, advises firms to begin by migrating applications that are “relatively low risk and fairly generic”. At this stage he advises against moving critical applications across. He explains:  “Where are the core processes that are absolutely ‘family silver’ to me?” He said “really, really critical data” should be left in these early stages. Understand your data security needs  Understand how secure your data needs to be – what’s sensitive and what’s not so sensitive? In a BBC blog  Rowan Trollope at Symantec advises firms to consult potential cloud providers on how they would meet their security requirements. He also advises you to get to know your provider before singing up – are they well regarded in the industry? Target apps born in the cloud A lot of new applications and services are born on the cloud – if you’re planning to migrate to the cloud it makes sense to consider these in your IT budget plans in the meantime. Dubbed systems of engagement (as opposed to systems of record such as HR, CRM systems) these applications cover things such as social, big data and mobile. Doug Clark explains: “Some of those newer areas are almost born on the cloud because they don’t have legacy architecture, or they have the potential for being born on the cloud, because you have them already.” He said because of this “you don’t need to migrate them, you don’t need to think about how can I move that?” as it’s already there. Start with something you know If the world of cloud computing is completely new to your firm, it may make things easier to start with something you already know. Some 1.3 billion people use Windows every day, while Microsoft Office is on more than 1 billion desktop PCs,  according to statistics . Glenn Woolaghan, UK SMB Director at Microsoft, suggests this means  Office 365  is the perfect place to begin your firm’s cloud adventure. He explained: “Even if you only use it for Office it is a comfier environment and a product suite that you are used to.” Office 365 is powered by the cloud, so you can access and create files in Word, Excel, PowerPoint from any PC or tablet from anywhere with a web connection. Once you know the service, expand  If your cloud provider has done a good job of handling the lower-risk applications, and you’re confident in their ability and satisfied with how the service is being operated, you can begin to expand. Cloud services can be turned on and off, affording you the luxury of trial and error. If cloud doesn’t appear right for a certain area of business, stop; if it’s working then roll out further. Glenn Woolaghan said companies who migrate to the cloud bit-by-bit “maintain agility and sovereignty by keeping some of the main business apps on site and then uploading to the cloud.\" Login or register to post comments Feed: Insight UK Blog Original article Connect: Authored by: Jon Smith Jon Smith is an EMEA e-Marketing Specialist for Insight UK a leading provider of hardware, software and services.

Why Your Business Needs Unified Comms Like it? 238 comments 0 Posted August 11, 2014   With so many communication options available, wouldn’t it be good if they were all connected in some way? Well, thanks to the rise of  unified communications (UC)  technology they can be and businesses of all sizes and budget can benefit. What is UC? In short, UC improves efficiency, collaboration and customer service through the integration of voice, video and data. We all know about Skype, but UC takes the concept to a whole new level as it enables different types of communication services such as phone, instant messaging and videoconferencing to be run on the same network as PCs. By moving your phone system to the web and using UC, your business can benefit in a number of ways. Better customer service/agility Improved internal communication Improved security – encrypted data Built for remote working Boost efficiency with intelligent phone functions How many times has a caller to your office been passed from pillar to post trying to reach the person they want to speak to? It happens frequently in many workplaces and doesn’t look professional but UC can change all that as it has many advanced functions designed to help the caller get through first time. UC enables multiple phones to ring at the same time wherever they are, so calls won’t be missed. It also offers advanced call forwarding to different types of device and employees can have a single number for all of their phones. That means they can start a call from their desk and continue it on their mobile while out of the office. Your phone and customer relationship management (CRM) system can be integrated with UC. When a customer calls, your employees will get a pop-up window displaying all of the client’s information on their PC or phone. How the presence of Presence can save time Another benefit of UC is what’s known as Presence technology, which lets you know the best way to contact someone and whether they’re available to talk to. The Presence indicator shows whether you can contact them on their mobile, home phone or desk phone, or whether they’re in a meeting and not to be disturbed. This can save you a lot of time and effort as you don’t have to spend ages trying to track someone down. Research for  Cisco  found that 49% of organisations saved up to 20 minutes per employee each day by reaching people on the first attempt. How UC can save you money? By adopting UC, you can significantly reduce your outgoings. For starters, it allows employees to work from home, saving you on equipment and office costs. Web and videoconferencing applications also reduce the need for business travel. According to research by  BT , travel cost reductions can be as much as 30%. Moreover, UC gives you cheaper calls than with a traditional telephone system. Calls made within the digital network or over the internet are free. UC can also simplify billing and predict how much your monthly spend will be. How UC can improve security? Security is always a major concern for businesses but UC software can encrypt information that’s being sent across the network, so you can be confident that email, VoIP messages and instant messaging aren’t being intercepted by outside threats. This is especially important for sensitive information. Is your business benefitting from UC? If so let us know how in the comments.

MSPs: Picking the Right Technology Partners Like it? 255 comment 1 Posted February 11, 2015 Managed Service Providers (MSPs) can find sustained success by building out a strong and highly complementary partner ecosystem. In the technology industry, the term 'ecosystem' is tossed around quite a bit. But for MSPs the right ecosystem makes all the difference for organic growth, flexible offerings and continuously meeting a wider variety of customer needs. MSPs have long been a growth segment for technology partner channels. Now MSPs should turn to fellow service providers as significant candidates for partnerships in their own ecosystems. So how can you find the right technology partners and then leverage those partnerships for greater competitive advantage? It involves a good deal of analysis that explores your business strategy, what your customers need, and what third party services can bring to your game. How do you want to structure your own partner ecosystem, how does it affect your go-to-market strategies, how does it benefit your business, and how does this help you better serve your customers? Other crucial questions to explore with potential partners:     How does the partner offering add value and innovation to your services? You need to ask this question to establish the breadth of the combined services. Then assess the impact of the \"new\" platform of services on your customers' business needs and goals. Another area to explore: does the combined platform add competitive differentiation from other MSPs? Revisit frequently what your partners visualize for future direction and new services that may provide further competitive advantage. If a partner seems to be stagnating, it may be time to search for someone new.      What's the plan for collaborative Marketing and Sales? If support for Marketing and Sales are in the mix, make sure that the prospective partner will deliver what you need. Explore in detail what the partner intends to do, what sort of timeline, examples from other partner experiences, and how strong the results were for generating new business. What sort of reporting and metrics will the partner provide to show activity and outcomes? What kind of resources does the partner have in place to provide strong support in this area? What's the dollar and cents bottom line? Take care not to solely focus on technology conversations. The financial side of any partnership is just as important. Fully discuss financial models to make sure that you pick one that integrates with your business model and goals. Make sure the financial arrangements provide the profitability you expect. How does the partner view the customer / end user experience? If you are strongly focused on a customer-centric business strategy (and you should be), find out if your potential partners share your passion for high quality customer and end user experiences. If a partner does not put a high priority on customer success with the overall services platform, you could be endangering your business.      What kind of specialized technical support will you receive? Once you have integrated the partner offering into your overall platform, you need to know that you will have dedicated support resources to quickly take care of your issues and those of your customers.  Partner ecosystems open up a lot of new business opportunities for MSPs – when they are based on the right strategies. As technologies and markets change, MSPs are shifting from traditional approaches to offer more innovative and timely services. But in building out a partner ecosystem, you must be alert to protecting your reputation as a trustworthy and reliable service provider. Your collaborations with other MSPs must add to your reputation, not jeopardize it.

Moving Target: Cybersecurity and Integrated Managed Services Like it? 278 comments 0 Posted July 31, 2015 Cybersecurity continues to encompass the pressing need for detailed, broad and varied solution capabilities. Implementing, maintaining and updating comprehensive cybersecurity solutions frequently seem to be daunting tasks for organizations of all sizes. Simplifying cybersecurity solutions is appealing as a beneficial goal -- but the more useful approach right now is to streamline integrated services to handle a broad range of capabilities. Often different industries require specialized security solutions; customization requirements are often part of the mix for many organizations. Managed services providers can cost-effectively handle these sorts of individualized needs as 'business as usual'.   Cybersecurity and the Cloud Like data management and analytics, the cloud impacts cybersecurity solutions on two fronts: the need to provide extensive cybersecurity capabilities for cloud-based applications and services; and the transition to security services and solutions based in the cloud themselves. A recent article quoted a survey that revealed the problems still challenging organizations for effective cybersecurity to protect work done in the cloud:   In the face of rapid growth of cloud infrastructure across IT, security has not been able to keep up with the pace of change. Approximately 65 percent of respondents say it takes three months or longer to deploy a new security solution for cloud infrastructure environments. The survey showed that more than three-quarters of survey respondents experience tool fatigue and nearly as many said traditional tools don't scale well in cloud environments… The survey showed that 77 percent of security leaders say they have too many point solutions to do security well in cloud environments, and 76 percent say they lack visibility into attacks through cloud infrastructure.                     Image source: CDN Comprehensive integrated / bundled managed services can contribute greatly to reducing the complexity of end-to-end cybersecurity solutions, while drawing on MSP expertise in multiple technology areas that matter greatly for effective cybersecurity. MSPs need to develop integrated services that address the needs of both cloud and on-premises technologies and work processes, while utilizing elastic methodologies to better defend overall infrastructures from cyber threats. Cloud-based cybersecurity services align well with the movement of managed services to the cloud, to increase flexibility and reduce costs in ways that pay off for clients. It's important to remember that cybersecurity is very technology-intensive and can be quite complex 'internally'. While MSPs can create streamlined services that work well for clients, the less viable notion right now is the ability to make cybersecurity \"simple\" (in the way that basic SaaS services are known for). It still takes well-experienced tech experts on the job to make sure everything is continuously updated and working optimally. Continuous Data Management and Analytics Data is an integral part of effective cybersecurity services, to build consolidated views across all infrastructures (cloud, on-premises) in order to locate and monitor cyber threats as they occur. Data must be analyzed, understood and put to work to continuously anticipate new threats and improve technologies and processes for better protection over time. Data sources include big data that comes from many areas both inside and outside the firewall. Big data analytics, combined with other data sources, can process: patterns of behavior preceding attacks; attack attributes; and other analyses -- to derive invaluable context to better understand how cybersecurity services should respond to and prevent threats. Predictive analytics processes lead to crafting methods to head off new kinds of attacks. Big data analytics will take MSPs into more 'creative' services that must continuously evolve and be highly responsive to the ultra-fast kaleidoscope of cyber attacks.   Through integrated / bundled managed services that encompass cybersecurity, cloud platforms, and data management and analytics, MSPs can take on all aspects of comprehensive cybersecurity solutions to free up in-house IT teams for other important tasks -- particularly for proactive business technology activities that directly support the business endeavors, goals and objectives of the organization.

Platform is in the Eye of the Beholder Like it? 440 comments 0 Posted January 1, 2012 Keywords : business intelligence platform , Book Review My friend and colleague Phil Simon recently published a new book called The Age of the Platform . I know from conversations with Phil that his new book is a personal journey to explore a very large and significant topic for which Phil has a lot of passion:  how business technology must evolve to provide the value and functionality that businesses need to move successfully and agilely into the future. Exploring on the Edge of Innovation Like many of us, Phil is an explorer. And he decided to explore a large area of business and technology – the successes and failures of companies that are based on platforms that consist of multiple offerings, ecosystems of partners and customer communities, and cultures of innovation (driven both internally and externally). He has taken the good kind of risk in putting together The Age of the Platform – he wants to move to somewhere new in his thinking and has shared the beginnings of that process in this book. Innovation comes from taking risks, taking leaps away from where one has been -- to find new places and ideas. Phil shows that his exploration of the Platform as business model also parallels his search for what he wants to do with his life in new phases of experience. In his forward, Mitch Joel nails what Phil is doing with his own journey: It’s tempting to stick with what has always worked best for you, but today it’s critical to explore new platforms – and to build your own. As obvious as this sounds, it’s amazing to see how many businesses refuse to experiment with new technologies and media. They’re afraid of new platforms. And Phil, after running through key questions to consider in order to decide if a platform will lead to fertile business growth, has this to say: If these questions make you feel uneasy, don’t worry. Embrace the uncertainty. Platforms require it.   The Age of the Platform I recommend that if you haven’t already read The New Small , go through it before reading The Age of the Platform . In The New Small Phil talks about businesses that are forward-moving, interested in varying degrees of business innovation, reasonably tech savvy, deeply interested in customer success with their services or products, and take the life of their businesses very personally since they are usually doing something they love. These “New Small-ers” understand that technology should only come into play if it clearly benefits the purpose of the business. The Age of the Platform provides value to businesses of all sizes that either: do not fully understand certain technology changes that are occurring and how they might impact their organizations; or do not understand how to innovate their businesses to survive and be more competitive – or both.  Reflecting what The New Small revealed, Phil’s discussion of the “change-tolerant business” is quite significant. Phil provides a quote from Robert Charnette: “A highly change-tolerant business can both adapt to and cause market turbulence for its own benefit”. Phil then goes on to explore how “knowledge is power” for achieving the change-tolerant business, especially in these times of:  burgeoning data and content, many new technologies, and many new ways to bring data and technology into a business for its benefit. While discussing ways that a “platform” mentality can be manifested in businesses of all sizes, Phil provides an excellent case in Hubspot. Hubspot is a source of internet marketing technologies and expertise for small businesses, particularly for inbound marketing and social media. The case was co-written by my friend and colleague Kirsten Knipp, now a VP at Hubspot, who shows that Hubspot is not only a technology platform that integrates with other platforms, but a platform of knowledge and innovation, thus becoming a “virtuous” platform of openness and sharing to benefit both Hubspot, its customers and partners. I highly recommend a thorough read of the Hubspot case to understand how a “platform” can be put into play for companies, since most companies are not Amazons or Googles.     You may not agree with everything Phil says in The Age of the New Platform but it’s likely that the book has provoked new thinking about how business and technology must evolve, and also opened up an examination of ideas and functions that may no longer be relevant for businesses that want to sustain competitiveness and innovation. Phil has invited his readers to interact with him at www.theageoftheplatform.com to continue the conversation.   Disclosure: I’m a friend and colleague of Phil Simon, I’ve read all of his books, and intend to read any new books he writes.   About the author : Julie Hunt is a software industry solution strategist and analyst, providing market and competitive insights.

Here are a few great ideas that you can use right now to give your business a little more control over massive amounts of data like what you would come across in the world of big data and how it is organized in certain forms. 1.       Focus on the use of web-based software. Sometimes your business will thrive if you just stick with web-based programs to handle large amounts of data. The problem with traditional servers and hard drives in the workplace is that it can be a challenge to get their materials out to more places at a given time. It will be up to you to use web-based programs that can be accessed from any computer and can work with cloud-based servers from another site. This should allow you to access your data in more spots and to have a much easier time with managing it in the long run. 2.       Organize mission-critical data to where it will be accessed first. Mission-critical data refers to the bits of data that must be used on a daily basis. If you cannot access it properly then you will be destined to struggle. You can organize this data by using a helpful big data-associated program like Apache Hadoop. A program may be incorporated into the process by securing background data in a separate space on your computers while the mission-critical data is upfront and accessible from more spaces. Doing this can help you to keep your data running right while giving you easy access to whatever you hold. 3.       Review the accuracy of your data. Data cleansing projects can help you to remove duplicate forms of data so your big data accounts will be easier to manage. You can also use cleansing projects to remove data that is obsolete and no longer required. The reason why these two processes are so important comes from how you can use them to keep your data as accurate as possible. Removing duplicates and obsolete bits of data makes it so your research and gathering processes will be streamlined with less data to wave around through. This should help with keeping your data from being far too difficult to manage. 4.       Create many traits or parameters for your data. You can organize your big data by creating a series of parameters that you can utilize right now. For instance, you can create codes that link big data volumes to certain databases based on their values, triggers and other special features. You can use as many parameters or traits as you want. The only key here is to find data that you know will be easier to utilize and will not be too complicated in any form. 5.       Assign certain parts of your data stores to different employees. Sometimes your data stores might contain components that are better suited towards certain people than others. If you assign specific parts of those stores to certain employees then it might be a little easier for you to get different items cataloged and maintained. More importantly, you can consider sending bits of data over to people who may be more likely to understand how to use those features. Organizing your data in the right manner is often the best thing to do when it comes to getting more out of your business and all of its critical features. Big data can be easier to handle if you just know what to do with it. Be careful with your data stores and you will certainly go far with them. Your plans should be a little easier to work with if you are fully observant of how things are going with your data and what you plan on doing with everything you are using.

With the explosion of big data, companies are faced with data challenges in three different areas. First, you know the type of results you want from your data but it’s computationally difficult to obtain. Second, you know the questions to ask but struggle with the answers and need to do data mining to help find those answers. And third is in the area of data exploration where you need to reveal the unknowns and look through the data for patterns and hidden relationships. The open source HPCC Systems big data processing platform can help companies with these challenges by deriving insights from massive data sets quickly and simply. Designed by data scientists, it is a complete integrated solution from data ingestion and data processing to data delivery. Their built-in Machine Learning Library and Matrix processing algorithms can assist with business intelligence and predictive analytics.

The Worst Case Scenario: Manufacturing Company Data Loss Like it? 84 comments 0 Posted August 23, 2016 Keywords : Data Management We don’t often like to think about the worst case scenario when it comes to our businesses, but the fact of the matter is that at any moment something terrible could happen with your business technology, resulting in data loss. You have to be prepared for every scenario and have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place. But what happens when you don’t have that plan in place? What happens when you waited too long and the worst case scenario of data loss is a reality? Maybe you can’t wrap your head around what that means - but that’s why we’re writing this: to remind you that not only is data loss a reality, but if you don’t take the appropriate measures, there are a few worst case scenario things that will inevitably happen in your manufacturing business.   Design engineers can’t design. Being in the business of manufacturing, odds are good that your engineers are working constantly on creating new designs and innovating for your customer base. Their machines are often power-stations, which fast processors and graphics cards that can handle the CAD or design software that they’re working on. Consider not only the lack of productivity that will occur if your network goes down but all those valuable and proprietary designs that are on their machines and your fileserver that you may or may not be able to recover. If you can’t recover that data, you’ve lost much more than just a few files. File server down. It’s not just about that property and those particular files, but all the ancillary files associated with your business processes. If your file server goes down - you have no ability to access your bids, orders, or service your customers at all. You lose that data and you’re back to square 1. You have to reach out and start those processes all over again. The amount of time it would take to manually get those orders back into play, not to mention the customers and orders you would inevitably lose in the meantime… it’s not a situation that you want to be in. Primary manufacturing equipment down. What happens when you can’t manufacture your core products? You can’t ship them. You can’t sell more. You’re not making money. Every second that your line is down is money wasted. That’s a lot of money down the drain. If it’s down long enough, it could be enough to put your company out of business. How critical is your data? How critical is avoiding business technology interruption? For most manufacturing companies, they can’t afford to lose their data, access to their servers, or their manufacturing equipment. For manufacturers more than anyone else, they need to be sure that uptime and data protection is a priority. These are the organization who could most benefit from the cloud or a business continuity strategy.

The 4 Industries That Can Most Benefit from Technology Innovation Like it? 90 comments 0 Posted September 19, 2016 Keywords : IT Can I just put this out there? Everyone can benefit from technology innovation. Faster, more innovative technology is going to make your employees more efficient and speed up business and customer service delivery. It’s not debatable, it’s an absolute fact. With faster, more efficient technology, the job gets done more efficiently as well. That said, some industries have more to lose from outdated technology than others. Those that aren’t updating their workstations will suffer from decreased employee efficiency and maybe higher turnover as a result, but there are a few industries that can benefit even more than professional services from innovative technology. Here are just a few of them: Manufacturing If production stops, your ability to make money is halted as well. For manufacturers, their designers have to be able to use software and their production team needs to be working constantly to deliver products to their suppliers and customers. Technology is important, but how important is innovating that technology? It can mean the difference between delivering more units and increasing to your sales goals this year. For example, if a widget manufacturer produces 500 units in an hour and is able to get a piece of software, faster machines or equipment that allows them to double that production - they’re effectively doubling their revenue. Of course, this is a very basic example, but seconds are important in the manufacturing industry, so make sure that your technology isn’t wasting a moment. Construction Efficiency on the job site is critical for construction companies to deliver on the right timeline and budget. The right technology can not only help construction organizations communicate efficiently from administrative office to job site, but also speeding up the bidding and planning process. BYOD, the cloud and a few of the right construction technology applications can work together to set an innovative construction company apart from its competition. Medical Technology innovation for the medical industry is a must, particularly because HIPAA is a regulating body that requires certain minimum IT security and machine standards. But beyond that, innovative technology means happier patients, less time on the phone and significantly less time in the waiting room and processing paperwork. Whether you’re integrating mobile devices in the exam room or using apps to make your exams more efficient and patient-friendly, there are so many things that can be done to innovate your technology in this industry and set yourself apart from your competition. Hospitality From the hotel industry to restaurants and beyond - your technology is going to ensure that your customers have the best possible experience. That means easy check-ins at your hotels and more efficient use of your workstations across the board. The buzzword this year has been customer experience, and nowhere is that more important than in the hospitality industry, where reviews can make or break your business. What does innovation look like here? Mobile ordering can make a server’s life more efficient and eliminate mistakes since orders are taken and put in at the same time. Automated check-in for hotels and resorts with an application for spa bookings and to view the status of their reservation are just a few ways that technology innovation is changing the game for this industry. There are two options - innovate or remain stagnant in your technology. While you’re considering it, more and more of your competitors are implementing improved systems and applications that can set them apart and make their employees and customers’ lives easier. While these industries, in particular, can definitely benefit from innovative technology, the fact is that it’s not limited to these few. Innovating your technology provides a boost in efficiency that seriously contributes to your bottom line, the experience of your customers and your employee satisfaction. What are you waiting for? Don’t you think it’s time you did something about your technology situation?

Why Migrating from Proprietary Software to Linux Is Cutting Costs for Ecommerce Like it? 176 comments 0 Posted June 26, 2014 Keywords : Linux , Cloud Computing Migrating your eCommerce operation from proprietary software to Linux can reduce costs and provide a stable platform for expansion. Proprietary software to Linux Migration Migrating eCommerce to Linux isn't new; Amazon did it in 2001 . At the time they saved $500 on software for each server, but the real driver was that they could use commodity X86 boxes rather than proprietary UNIX servers, saving around $50k per server. A lot has changed since then. Commodity servers running Linux are the norm, virtualisation and Cloud services are common, but some organisations are still running UNIX or Windows systems because Linux migration seems like a lot of work and a big risk. It didn't do Amazon any harm though, did it? How it’s cutting costs The first step to making savings is establishing where the money goes at the moment, and this varies from organisation to organisation, so a thorough assessment is needed. ●     Are your developers constantly tinkering trying to keep an old system on the road? ●     Is the operations team always adding new bits of hardware and changing the way things work to accommodate more customers and a wider range of services? ●     Is the whole thing becoming increasingly unstable, potentially costing you sales? Who is saving? Many eCommerce retailers have moved to Linux-based systems with great success by working with a Linux and Open Source IT Consultancies like LinuxIT. NetPlayTV is the UK's largest interactive TV gaming company developing interactive products people can play on TV, online and on their mobile. NetPlayTV needed a proactive partner and a safe pair of hands for their Linux server estate working alongside their other technology partners. NetPlayTV’s transformation They wanted an organisation that could take over from their incumbent and provide them with a roadmap to transform their environment and move from manual to automated deployment. They also wanted a partnership which could help them grow their business giving them the ability and opportunity to make transformations to take them where they want to go as a business. Through our DevOps approach LinuxIT created a closer relationship as we work with NetPlayTV as part of their internal IT team. LinuxIT recommended, planned and built Puppet recipes and then deployed replica estates into two new data centres to prove it works. As well as implementing other system management tools, NetPlayTV now has control over patch management because it is de-risked, repeatable and predictable. They now have a truly scalable solution to manage their business with. LinuxIT managed the current environment, transformed it and managed through the transformation. It is clear that removing unpredictability and risk, freeing staff from firefighting and allowing them to concentrate on improving operations and growing the business brought real benefits, lowering the TCO and delivering better ROI.

How to Demonstrate the Value of Your IT Strategy to Gain Buy-in Across the Organisation Like it? 108 comments 0 Posted October 9, 2015 Keywords : Cloud Computing , IT Discover how to establish the value of your IT strategy, gaining buy-in across the organisation View the infographic in full here   Time to spread the word Your new IT strategy has been accepted by the board. It WILL happen. But how quickly it beds down and shows real benefits depends on everyone in the organisation - regardless of their role - being ready to accept it. But do it with care IT Directors love change, it gives them something to put on their CVs. While the wider IT team will buy into your strategy, other departments are going to be more reluctant. People don't like change Production workers, administrators, sales, accounts and support teams prefer things to stay the same. Reasons they might be reluctant to buy in to your IT strategy include concerns around stability, business downtime and ability to use the new systems. Strong communication skills required That’s why communication and collaboration is vital. You should explain in clear simple terms why the new or improved IT strategy is important to the organisation’s success now and in the future. Speak to small groups and teams, adjusting your communication to target each group and their particular issues. Think about your end-users It's very easy to assume that high level strategy only involves the buy-in of the 'C-Suite', but what appear to be minor changes to ways of working through the introduction of new applications, technologies, infrastructures or services, can cause problems for the end-users. Having to learn new skills and applications can feel daunting and problematic. For the business itself, this can lead to a lack of continuity, potentially leading to downtime. Set in their ways? Many workers fear learning new skills and will treat your proposed IT strategy with more reluctance than anyone from the C-Suite. Your strategy will be implemented by people with years of muscle memory and a host of unofficial working methods that may no longer be effective. It's a learning process To address these issues set up training sessions where workers at all levels can learn the new technology or way of working. This can give them a safe and secure environment to make mistakes and learn from them. It will also become a shared learning experience which benefits the whole organisation, rather than just the C-suite who may have very little to do with your IT strategy after it has been signed off. Not another IT change! Many workers will have had experience - in less enlightened organisations than yours of course - of trying to master a new system with minimal training whilst being expected to maintain output. Getting teams on board There is a lot of US-focussed Business School information online about team building and the organisational culture of IT firms. UK managers are increasingly buying into this, but UK workers at times remain sceptical. Become a confidence-builder The C-Suite and fellow members throughout the organisation know that if the organisation doesn't succeed, their jobs might be in jeopardy. This can lead to a fear of change, particularly when it comes to your IT strategy. A straightforward, collaborative approach and appeal to common-sense and self-interest will win more buy-in than team building and flag waving. Takeaways: In order to get buy-in you need across the organisation, remember to: Ask teams what they need from your IT strategy Offer training session that will up-skill workers so they can work with the new strategy, rather than against it Create a clear and collaborative communication plan so everyone understands the benefit of your IT change plan.  This post first appeared on the LinuxIT blog   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Simon Mitchell Simon Mitchell is the executive director and co-founder of  LinuxIT , the UK-based Linux environment specialists - designed and built against best practice standards.

Is the Data in Your CRM a Ticking Time Bomb? Like it? 313 comment 1 Posted January 16, 2015 Keywords : CRM Customer relationship management (CRM) has moved from specialist term to buzzword, and now, into the core of business. According to a blog by Sugar CRM,  about 15 million people used some kind of CRM system in 2012. The same blog says that large businesses were more likely to adopt CRM software first, since the potential benefits are so much greater. Gartner is well known for its predictions, and its analysis of the market is clear: the appeal of the CRM is growing, and smaller businesses are able to adopt the technology thanks to affordable pricing and cloud hosting. Gartner predicts that CRM software will grow at a rate of  14.8% through to 2017 . That’s a lot of data being collected – and a huge potential for expense. Harvest Time The maturing CRM market is a reflection of our desire for data. Data lets us understand our customers, communicate more effectively with those customers, and segment them for more effective marketing. This is why many businesses harvest massive amounts of data about their customers and store it in their CRM, then leave it to fester, either neglecting it or harvesting even more. Over time, simply collecting this data gives you your first potential for a ticking time bomb. The CRM becomes clogged up and weighed down by old and inaccurate contact records. This wastes money when it’s time to do mailshots, but it also wastes your employees’ time as they struggle to figure out which records are too old to be trusted. Fancy Fields As the CRM has become a standard feature in business, employees are expected to collect a broader set of data. Social media metrics are brought in, and soon there’s an embarrassment of riches: data about every interaction with every customer, or every lead that’s come into contact with your team. Each record could have hundreds of potential fields. Maintaining all of these different records is a challenge for users, since manual entry becomes incredibly cumbersome when you add more potential entries. It’s human nature to try to take short cuts, so there’s a perfect storm brewing: a combination of highly specialised fields and a workforce who simply don’t have the time to populate them as you’d like them to. There are two possible outcomes from this. One, you wind up with missing and incomplete data – a customer service disaster waiting to happen. Two, you could accumulate a large amount of data that is completed without due care and attention, making it poor quality right from the word go. Sure, you could hire an administrator to manually  fight the flow of bad data , but a continual flow of poor quality data coming in, combined with natural decay, means the return on investment will be next to nil. Protection and Security Most CRM software is designed for security, but there are always a few cracks in the armour.  An unmanaged CRM is a possible source of a leak , and poor data handling can expose holes in your processes and workflows – flaws that could cost you dearly. The Information Commissioner’s Office has the power to levy fines up to £500,000 for the poor handling of personal data, and there’s talk of these being increased to 5 per cent of global turnover. Information security is not optional, and anyone collecting customer data is vulnerable to prosecution, prison and brand disaster. One of the key provisions of this law is giving people control, allowing them to update and remove data at will. Could your CRM support this kind of granular maintenance? And is it in any fit state for you to try? Decayed and dirty data in CRM systems and contact databases is costing businesses tens of thousands of pounds ever year, through penalties, brand damage and more. Poor record keeping, poor security and a failure to comply with consumer requests is a risk your business would be crazy to ignore.  See the 8 Data protection principles by the ICO . Staff Morale Valuing staff is essential to limit churn and raise morale, and giving them the correct tools for the job is part of that. If you don’t solve your employees’ problems, you’re fighting a losing battle, and you will eventually lose them Failing to acknowledge data decay, or take action to reverse the tide, is a sure fire way to store up problems for the future. As your CRM data becomes less useful, employees will waste their time trying to come up with workarounds. The CRM will become the system legendary for its poor data quality, and new staff will be warned off it from day one. If you want your CRM to be used, and if you want it to support your employees, don’t expect them to work around its problems. Saving the CRM CRM data goes out of date every day. In the last 48 hours, someone in your database probably changed their email address, sold their house, got a new mobile number, moved offices, got a promotion or got married. It is an inevitability of data collection. If you are collecting data without any thought of data quality, your CRM could be a ticking time bomb. Data cannot be trusted, enhanced or relied upon if it is becoming irrelevant and out-dated. Adding more data could just be increasing the likelihood of an explosion. Paying lip service to data quality with manual edits simply places your staff on an unfair trajectory towards failure. Think of a CRM like a database. It contains records that are unusually time-sensitive: addresses, names, people’s personal details. Not only does this data decay incredibly quickly, but poor management could land you in hot water if you fail to meet compliance obligations. Data quality is therefore one of the biggest and most relevant risks to your CRM, and the longer you ignore it, the worse it will get.

Predictive Analytics: The Dos and Don'ts Like it? 259 comment 1 Posted October 17, 2016 Keywords : Predictive Analytics , Big Data For organizations looking to make the most out of their relationships and processes, the discovery of meaningful information via analysis can often prove valuable and lead to substantial insight. Data that reveals facts about customers, for example—such as identifying customers who cancel accounts and leave for the competition, those in a specific cross-demographic, or even those in a specific income range who have contacted the call center three or more times in the last six months—is data that can be acted upon. These insights allow for a deeper understanding of not just customer behavior, but also logistical bottlenecks, project effectiveness and more. But to get the most value from these insights, it’s necessary to extend findings into business activities via predictive analytics. This means utilizing insights to identify where slowdowns in processes are, and take steps to alleviate it on future loops or predict a customer’s future behavior. To achieve positive results with predictive analytics initiatives and ensure the results are integrated with business processes, there are numerous aspects to prioritize—and pitfalls to avoid. Indeed, there are countless ways predictive analytics can enhance processes, but before they are put into use organizations must consider the following “Do’s” and “Don’ts”:  DO: Make proactive rather than reactive decisions  - Results provide insight on likely behaviors. Armed with this information, organizations can encourage positive activities and reduce negative ones. DON’T: Fail to focus on a specific business initiative  – Focusing on a specific business initiative reduces the chance of “analysis paralysis,” where effort is wasted on trying to fit the analysis findings to an undefined objective.  DO: Focus on projects that will impact the bottom line: either generate profits or reduce costs  – These types of projects are more tangible and this easier to gain approval for, which enables an organization to capitalize on gathered data. DON’T: Ignore crucial steps, such as data preparation and access  – When deploying predictive analytics, many companies overlook important steps in the process. One of the most frequently ignored is data preparation and access. In reality, this should be the activity to which the most effort is devoted. In fact, data preparation typically accounts for approximately 60 to 80 percent of the cost of a predictive modeling initiative. DO: Take a broad view of the process and develop a holistic approach to the solution  – If you focus only on one aspect—i.e. gathering a certain set of data points—it’s possible you won’t be as prepared as needed for the process of leveraging it, and time is often of the essence as data is constantly changing. Ensure ahead of time that options are available for acting on predictive analytics when you’ve gathered the insight. DON’T: Spend too much time evaluating models  – Companies often tend to over-evaluate. They add new variables to the models to increase their accuracy, which often requires rebuilding, delays deployment, and prevents the organization from realizing the substantial advantages that predictive analytics can offer. DO: Perform a thorough collection and exploration of the data  – Identifying data quality issues, gleaning initial insight, and detecting relevant subsets not only enables those working with the data to become more familiar with it but helps assure that any analyses performed will be done more efficiently and with greater accuracy. DON’T: Invest in tools that yield little or no returns  – When it comes to the computing environment, organizations typically look to implement two systems: one for predictive analytics, and a reporting system to deliver results. This creates additional and unnecessary hardware, support, and maintenance costs. A simpler and more cost-effective approach is to combine these into a single environment. DO: Prepare the data  – Be careful to select the relevant data when choosing tables, records, and attributes from various sources across the business. Data must then be transformed, merged, aggregated, derived, sampled, and weighed. It is then cleaned and enhanced to optimize results. DON’T: Fail to operationalize findings  – If an application is not built and deployed, or a tangible change to a process made as a result of predictive analytics findings, the effort devoted to preparing and creating a model, not to mention collecting and analyzing data, will have done nothing to enhance forward-looking decision-making. The results will remain in a document that few people will refer to in support of their daily activities. DO: Select and apply various modeling techniques  – In addition to having properly prepared data, you must be sure to use the analysis techniques that are best suited for your purpose. Some techniques may explain the underlying patterns in data from a more useful angle than others, and therefore the outcomes of various modeling methods must be compared. Avoiding these common planning errors and adopting the best practices outlined above can be the difference between successfully implemented predictive analytics and wasted potential. These do’s and don’ts are a roadmap to help organizations take complete advantage of their data, accelerate implementations, and glean insights that can be acted upon.   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: Rado Kotorov Dr. Rado Kotorov is the Chief Innovation Officer for business intelligence (BI) and analytics provider  Information Builders  and co-author of  Organizational Intelligence: How Smart Companies Use Information to Become More Competitive and Profitable .  He is responsible for analyzing market and technology trends, aiding in the development of innovative product roadmaps, and creating rich programs ...

Largest HIPAA Breach Ever: Hackers Steal Data on 4.5 Million Community Health Systems Patients Like it? 338 comments 0 Posted August 21, 2014 Keywords : data security , privacy There’s a new leader on the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Wall of Shame . A hacking group known as “APT 18” is suspected of stealing names, Social Security numbers, addresses, birthdays and telephone numbers from 4.5 million patients of Community Health Systems, a network of 206 hospitals across 29 states (see map at right). Credit card numbers and medical records were not accessed. It’s the largest attack involving patient information since the HHS started tracking HIPAA breaches in 2009, passing a Montana Department of Public Health breach that affected roughly 1 million people. Patients who were referred or received services from doctors affiliated with Community Health Systems in the last five years were affected, the company reported in a regulatory filing on Monday. The sophisticated malware attacks occurred in April and June. According to numerous news reports, security experts said the hacker group may have links to the Chinese government. Charles Carmakal, managing director of the Mandiant forensics unit, hired by the hospital group to consult on the hack, told Reuters that “APT 18” typically targets companies in the aerospace and defense, construction and engineering, technology, financial services and healthcare industry. In an Online Tech webinar titled “ Why is it So Hard to Secure a Company ,” security expert Adam Goslin discussed how the past decade has seen “a continuous and steady increase in attempts by specifically the Chinese attempting to gain intellectual property.” According to a CNN report, Mandiant and federal investigators told the hospital network that the hacking group has previously conducted corporate espionage to target information about medical devices. This time, however, the bounty was patient data. Community Health Systems stated in a release: “Our organization believes the intruder was a foreign-based group out of China that was likely looking for intellectual property. The intruder used highly sophisticated methods to bypass security systems. The intruder has been eradicated and applications have been deployed to protect against future attacks.” In his aforementioned webinar, Goslin, the CEO of Total Compliance Tracking , detailed examples of the value of intellectual property theft: One of the stories that the FBI was bringing up was the Chinese were trying to get into a manufacturing facility to get a sample of a rinse solution for some type of a glass manufacture. It was a coating for glass and they couldn’t figure how they were doing it. So, the Chinese were trying to get a hold this of this rinse solution in the manufacturing setting. … There was a story of an organization that had spent some number of years developing a patent. They were just about to file it and found that they have gotten hacked by the Chinese. The Chinese filed for the patent. Because the organization’s entire business revolved around this work, they literally had to pay royalties to the Chinese just to use the patent that they developed themselves that got hacked out from under them. The value of personal information is clear: Hackers can sell the information to those looking to steal identities. And hospital networks are becoming a hotbed for finding that information. Michael “Mac” McMillan, CEO of security consulting firm CynergisTek, told Modern Healthcare that hospitals are “going to become a bigger and bigger target as the hacking community figures out it’s easier to hack a hospital than it is to hack a bank and you get the same information. I’m not sure healthcare is listening yet.” McMillan told the website there has been a spike in hacking activity directed at hospitals this year: “I know at least a half a dozen or so hacks against hospitals we work with where the data wasn’t transferred, but it still caused a lot of disruption,” McMillan said. “But it wasn’t a HIPAA issue, so it didn’t get reported.” Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: April Sage Online Tech is the Great Lakes leader in secure, compliant enterprise-class cloud and colocation hosting services.

Looking Ahead: Predicting Industry Trends in 2015 Like it? 333 comments 0 Posted January 2, 2015 What does 2015 have in store for the data center and cloud computing industries? We sat down with Online Tech co-CEOs Yan Ness and Mike Klein to get some of their informed predictions: Mike Klein Klein on the changing customer requirements for cloud and data centers: “One of the most significant trends in the cloud and data center market in 2015 will be the way companies in industries outside of healthcare, retail and finance will start to incorporate security and privacy into their cloud requirements —making security and privacy the rule in 2015 rather than the exception. In the past, that level of security has typically only been seen in the project requirements that cloud companies and data center companies get from healthcare customers. But in 2015, the expectations and requirements on security and privacy will expand dramatically because companies across many verticals will need to better protect critical information, including HR-related employee files, confidential documents with intellectual property and confidential communications. Our industry needs to be prepared for every customer to have the same standards for security and confidentiality as companies that operating under HIPAA.” Yan Ness Ness on the growth of the cloud and data center industry in the Midwest: “In 2015, a lot of the growth in the cloud and data center industry is going to be outside of the traditional geographic markets. Yes, there will still be a lot going on in Silicon Valley and New York/New Jersey and the other top six U.S. markets, but I think the biggest story will be elsewhere. There are a tremendous number of projects in secondary markets that don’t typically get the headlines in the data center and cloud industry, and the Midwest will be a hot spot that people should be watching. Midwestern cities like Detroit and Indianapolis and Minneapolis are getting major investments for cloud and data center infrastructure, not only because of the growth in the local economies there but also because these locations are very appealing for disaster recovery because they are such safe locations to save data.” Klein on the growth of hybrid clouds: “Another trend that is going to gather a lot of steam in 2015 is the implementation of hybrid clouds. More and more companies will be looking to extend their internal private clouds outward and integrate them with enterprise-grade off-site clouds from hosting providers—and this process will be particularly challenging for companies that must meet security and privacy regulations like those related to PCI , HIPAA and Safe Harbor . Few cloud providers have experience with hybrid cloud implementations that can meet that level of security and data protection, so many cloud provides will be playing catch-up on how to support this next wave of major cloud projects.” Ness on security and privacy taking center stage: “Security and privacy have always been important parts of the conversation for data center and cloud projects, but they are going to be center stage in 2015 in a way that has never happened before. The Sony Pictures hacking incident is going to be a big catalyst for this, because it is such a high profile example of the vulnerability that corporations face in protecting their data. No longer will those issues be limited primarily to discussions of healthcare data or classified government data. In 2015, security and privacy will be a top priority across every industry, and providers who aren’t ready to meet these needs are going to be at a major disadvantage.” Cheers to 2015!

Mass digitization: Opportunity or threat to IT? Like it? 141 comments 0 Posted May 4, 2016 Keywords : Big Data , IT All forms of media have been dramatically transformed by their digitization, including video, music, the classifieds, magazines and pictures. This digital transformation enabled a new business model and was an onslaught that decimated the print and analog industries as we knew them. Now data virtualization is heading for IT. Is that a bad thing? IT professionals claim they benefit from it. All of this virtualization will call for more and more of their expertise, they say. As everyone digitizes everything, the world needs more servers, more storage, more memory, more connectivity, more software and more people who can make it all work. But I can imagine a discussion that was had by the old-guard leaders of the newspaper industry. “The ever-growing and aging population will consume ever-increasing quantities of news,” they said. Well, they were right that more and more people wanted to consume more and more news content. But they completely missed that it wouldn’t be in print. It would be in a new form—one they didn’t anticipate and that came on faster than they predicted. Their newspaper had been virtualized, and hence, they failed to exist. And when something becomes digitized, it becomes more available to the masses, meaning companies must adapt or perish. The newspaper industry’s equivalent is blogging—everyone’s a blogger these days, and anyone can write news and put it online—for free. Journalism and its business model evolved at a breakneck pace, and leaders couldn’t adapt. The same holds true for IT. We are right that there will be an ever-increasing demand for digital content. But we can’t assume our skills will remain relevant as that happens. In fact, I predict that many of the IT skills currently in demand will experience a similar trend as those who ran printing presses in the 80s for those same old-guard newspapers. Many of the jobs that were considered “hot” in 2010  didn’t even exist in 2004 . Jobs that will be in demand in 2020 probably don’t exist today. Why do I think this? Because we’re going through mass data virtualization right now, thanks to the growth of cloud computing. Servers, storage and networks are all being virtualized – which is exactly what a digital version of a newspaper is. And what happens when you virtualize something? That metamorphosis results in a transformational change. Transformation is both highly creative but also very destructive. Once something is virtualized, it can be instantly transported across the globe, instantly searchable, modifiable by software so it can be customized, along with a plethora of other traits. Those traits add so much value it makes the physical rendition completely obsolete. For example, 10 years ago, if you wanted to ship 1,000 CDs from your New York apartment to your beach house in Florida, you had to put them in a box and physically ship them. But when the first iPod came out, you could put those 1,000 CDs onto  one  device and carry that with you. Music became virtualized, and think about how your life changed with that simple concept. It’s this level of change that will continue to drive IT forward, and we as “IT guys” must adapt to virtualization or become obsolete ourselves. If I tell a 55-year-old IT technician I can email him a laptop or server, he tells me “that’s so amazing.” It’s not amazing—it’s the way of the world. But all of us, young and old alike, must adapt more and more quickly to the exponential growth of information and technology or risk becoming obsolete. How do we adapt? I believe DevOps is the future. It’s not that we won’t still need equipment—of course we will. But it’s what we do with that equipment that will determine whether we survive in this digital world or not. Think about the growth of electronic music. The structure is still the same. There is still demand for musical instruments, and there always will be. But what electronic music does is remix the original music and transform it into something new. In the same way, DevOps is remixing IT and leading the way in transforming how we view software, networks, servers and storage. I don’t see any reason why the continued virtualization of data won’t be as transformational to the IT industry as virtualizing a newspaper was to newspapers or virtualizing photos was to film. What will be digitized next, and how will we react to that digitization? More importantly, will you be part of the team that makes those transformational changes happen?

Encryption is the key to the data kingdom Like it? 572 comments 2 Posted April 22, 2016 Keywords : Analytics Encryption is becoming more and more a part of our personal and professional lives. One could even argue that we can’t live without it. In fact, it’s become so standardized that Amazon recently announced it was bringing  back  encryption to its Kindle Fire tablet after removing it in a previous version  and hearing  customer complaints . And with all the media coverage surrounding Apple’s  latest encryption fight , it’s safe to say it’s at the forefront of security-related minds. Encryption, which typically uses an algorithm that scrambles your data until a key is presented to unlock it, is all about data protection. It’s easy to implement and can protect you if your device is stolen or lost, as long as your encryption key is not compromised as well. Whether you use it or not, depends on what data of yours is worth protecting. Think of all of the data that you access regularly online. Your email, pictures, address book  and even your bank account. Whatever the case, when your personal information is hacked, it can cause quite a headache and (potential) embarrassment trying to get your data back, not to mention the risk and problems that are associated with having your identity stolen. Now imagine your corporate identity stolen, and the repercussions that come with that. You could lose your job and your company could possibly go out of business. If you’re in the healthcare industry, it could be  even worse . It doesn’t sound like a risk worth taking, does it? Society is demanding the ability to encrypt their devices, whether they be for work or play purposes, and companies are catering to that demand. And even though it’s a popular subject right now, it’s easy to forget what encryption is all about—protecting your data. No matter whether it’s work or personal, protecting your data is key.

Selling IT disaster recovery to your board of directors Like it? 153 comments 0 Posted April 18, 2016 Keywords : IT   IT Disaster recovery is all about protecting your data, and the cost of data loss can be staggering.  According to the Institute for Business and Home Safety , an estimated 25 percent of businesses do not reopen following a major disaster. As a business, you spend an enormous amount of time, planning, and money into making your organization successful. But what are you doing to protect yourself against a disaster? If it’s time for you to re-evaluate your current DR position, make sure your board of directors knows the above statistic and remembers to budget accordingly. The most important point to make when it comes to selling DR to your board is that they recognize the company’s sensitivity to downtime, which is typically gathered from a Business Impact Analysis. That cost or impact will be different for each company, but if your application is a major source of revenue for you, it may only be minutes or even seconds that you can afford to lose. That’s not a lot of time. If you have hard numbers to back up your downtime sensitivity, that will have a huge impact on your board. It will equate back to revenue, lost customers and a damaged image in the marketplace, which is what board is most likely focused on. For further effect, show how the cost of building, maintaining and having a DR infrastructure is realized if your site has a certain amount of downtime. You’ll probably face concerns about these two points: How much it will cost to maintain something you might not need? What’s the likelihood that you  really  will have a disaster that completely wipes out your production site? These can be, unfortunately, hard to answer, because you simply never know what will happen. You could face an equipment failure, catastrophic data loss, or a power outage long enough to affect your emergency power source. All of these scenarios (as well as many more) are very likely, and given your sensitivity to downtime are probably more likely than your executive team is willing to live with. However, with what’s happening in the world nowadays it’s unlikely you’ll have much trouble selling DR to your board. Most companies are already aware of the importance of disaster recovery and allocate budgets to it accordingly. Ignorance or naivety are no longer factors in denying funds to IT departments for DR. Once you’ve cleared the hurtle of selling DR itself, it’s time to propose the options you’ve identified. Unless you are a sizable company, you probably shouldn’t host the infrastructure yourself. If you have to look into all avenues though, determine a CAPEX appropriate for your company size and business needs, and do some research to see how much you need to fully support a DR solution yourself (this includes licensing costs, staff time and recurring training, just to name a few). Compare your results to what a service provider charges, and recommend the option that is more valuable to your company. There are some  major advantages  to using Disaster Recovery as a Service: Your time to deployment will be much faster You’ll be able to take advantage of the provider’s staff expertise, freeing your department to focus on your core competencies Your ability to use the provider’s monitoring and reporting tools to track adherence to your SLA You will realize potentially millions in savings in capital costs, leaving you only with operating expenses, which are much more manageable Oh, and you’ll sleep better at night! When it comes to protecting your data, disaster recovery is a critical step. Leveraging the talents and resources of a DRaaS provider can alleviate the monetary concerns that come with hosting your infrastructure yourself. Make sure your CEO or board of directors understands the economic advantages of making such an investment and approves an option that protects your business.   Login or register to post comments Connect: Authored by: April Sage Online Tech is the Great Lakes leader in secure, compliant enterprise-class cloud and colocation hosting services.

Top 5 criteria to consider in a data protection provider Like it? 137 comments 0 Posted May 24, 2016 Keywords : Security , Big Data Your organization’s data is  money  unaccounted for on the balance sheet, and it must be protected. A secure production site with no single point of failure goes a long way, but disaster recovery is the insurance that keeps you running in case of a fire, cyber attack, or accidental database wipe. Many factors, most importantly cloud economics, have been a  driving factor  in the growth of disaster recovery, making it imperative to business continuity. You need simple data protection. There are a few things to look for, including a provider whose  economy of scale  and economy of knowledge you can leverage. What else should you look for in a provider? As a technical architect, I’ve had a lot of experience working with different technologies and understanding what clients need to keep their operations running. Below is what I think is the most important criteria when evaluating potential hosting providers. Transparency and visibility into maintaining SLA around RPO and RTO:  Perhaps what is most important is the Service Level Agreement between you and your provider. What is it, and does it meet the needs of your applications? More importantly, does it meet the needs of your users? You can only afford a certain amount of downtime, and you need a clear understanding of your provider’s ability to recover and restore your operations within the timeframe that works for you. Will you have enough reserve resources?  When disaster strikes, you never know what will happen. What if you experience an outage during peak user times? You and your provider need enough compute and memory resources, disk space, network connectivity and bandwidth to handle the production stack failure  and  the surge in user activity. Ask your provider what their offerings are and get resources dedicated specifically for you. Expert staff:  Outsourcing is done for a reason – you don’t have the time, people or resources to manage your stack. That means you need someone who has knowledge of how your applications are configured and what they need to run smoothly while making sure they stay in sync with each other. If your provider doesn’t understand that, they can’t architect a solution to fit your needs, and your site may not be replicated properly. You don’t want to find that out in the middle of a failover. Clear process:  In line with the above point, you also need dedicated, expert staff to coordinate the failover process should you need to move to your recovery site. You’re hiring someone to be physically present when your equipment fails, so be sure they’re actually there. Do they also have a clear and detailed process for failing  back  to your production site when it is ready? You’ll need the same knowledge and expertise of your infrastructure, network configuration, hardware and software at your production site as you do with your recovery site. Testing, testing:  The status of your recovery site should be available in real time and easy to understand. Does your provider offer simulated and live testing? Do they handle all testing for you, or can you test yourself? Find out how often you can test. You should test at bare minimum once a year, preferably more often. Don’t ignore this critical part of your DR plan. When it comes to hiring the right data protection provider, nothing can be overlooked. If you pick someone who offers more than just Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS), you’ll save money and many hours scrambling to contact your other vendors when you suddenly need extra resources for your stacks. If you follow each of my considerations, at the end of the day, you’ll find yourself with a true business partner, not just a data protection vendor.

The Dirty (Not so Secret) Secret of IT Budgets Like it? 275 comments 4 Posted September 30, 2013 Keywords : Analytics , as a service , cloud applications , cloud infrastructure , cloud platform , cloud use cases , experimentation , IT budgeting , legacy systems , OPEX vs. CAPEX , rapid prototyping , risky business , Culture/Leadership , Cloud Computing , Data Mining , IT , Commentary , SmartData Collective Exclusive Some business users believe that every year IT is handed a budget, which is then fully used to drive new and productive ways to enable more business. This is, however, far from reality. In fact, in most instances the lion’s share of the IT budget is dedicated towards supporting legacy code and systems. With so precious few IT dollars to support experimentation with new technologies, it makes sense why pay-per-use cloud computing options are so alluring. There’s an interesting story in the Financial Times , where author Gillian Tett discusses how in western economies most of the dollars lent by banks go to supporting existing assets, and not innovation. The problem is highlighted by former UK regulator Adair Turner who says, out of every dollar in credit “created” by UK banks; only 15% of financial flows go into “productive investment”. The other 85% goes to supporting “existing corporate assets, real estate and unsecured personal finance.” Essentially, there are fewer dollars lent by banks for innovative projects, startups, and new construction with most of the monies dedicated to maintaining existing assets. Sounds a lot like today’s IT budgets. As evidence, a Cap Gemini report mentions; “Most organizations do not have a clear strategy for retiring legacy applications and continue to spend up to three quarters of their IT budgets just “keeping the lights on” - supporting outdated, redundant and sometimes entirely obsolete systems.”  Now if this “75%” statistic is still in fashion, and there is evidence that it’s accurate , it leaves very little funds for high potential projects like mobile, analytics, and designing new algorithms that solve business problems. Here’s where cloud computing can make a difference.  Cloud computing infrastructures, platforms and applications often allow users to try before they buy with very little risk. Users can test applications, explore new application functions and features, experiment with data, and stand up analytic capabilities with much less fuss than traditional IT routes. Best of all, much of this “experimentation” can be funded with operating budgets instead of going through the painful process of asking the CFO for a CAPEX check.  Speaking of innovation, the real value of cloud isn’t just the fact that information infrastructure is at the ready and scalable, but more what you can use it for. Take for example, the use of cloud based analytics to drive business value, such as sniffing out fraud in banking and online payment systems, exploring relationships between customers and products, optimizing advertising spend, analyzing warranty data to produce more quality products and many more types of analyses.  These kinds of analytics stretch far beyond the mundane “keeping the lights on” mindset that IT is sometimes associated with, and instead can really show line of business owners how IT can be more than a just a “game manager” but rather a “play-maker”. Fortunately, the modernization of legacy systems is a top priority for CIOs . But much like turning an aircraft carrier, it’s going to take time to make a complete switch from maintaining legacy systems to supporting innovative use cases. But in the meantime, with cloud, there’s no need to wait to experiment with the latest technologies and/or try before you buy. Cloud infrastructures, platforms and applications are waiting for you. The better question is, are you ready to take advantage of them?

First off, I am not a security expert, nor do I “play one on TV”.  That said, I do know that plenty of cloud companies leverage ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 in designing, configuring and implementing information security management systems. In addition, cloud service provider environments can be configured to comply with government or industry data privacy or regulatory compliance requirements including PCI-DSS, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley, GLBA, Safe Harbor and more. I also know of some cloud providers that specialize in hosting and performing analyses on sensitive financial services data. I am seeing more and more companies starting to trust cloud providers with their sensitive corporate data. But security really is a two way street. A cloud provider can only do so much on their end – the customer must also have appropriate security policies, procedures and risk controls in place to prevent unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data.

Beware of Big Data Technology Zealotry Like it? 553 comments 0 Posted June 23, 2014 Keywords : Analytics , Hadoop , Risk Management , risky business , Data Warehousing , Hardware , Best Practices , Data Visualization , Culture/Leadership , Open Source , Predictive Analytics , Big Data , Commentary , SmartData Collective Exclusive Undoubtedly you’ve heard it all before: “Hadoop is the next big thing, why waste your time with a relational database?” or “Hadoop is really only good for the following things” or “Our NoSQL database scales, other solutions don’t.” Invariably, there are hundreds of additional arguments proffered by big data vendors and technology zealots inhabiting organizations just like yours. However, there are few crisp binary choices in technology decision making, especially in today’s heterogeneous big data environments. Teradata CTO Stephen Brobst* has a great story regarding a Stanford technology conference he attended. Apparently in one session there were “shouting matches” between relational database and Hadoop fanatics as to which technology better served customers going forward. Mr. Brobst wasn’t amused, concluding; “As an engineer, my view is that when you see this kind of religious zealotry on either side, both sides are wrong. A good engineer is happy to use good ideas wherever they come from.” Considering various technology choices for your particular organization is a multi-faceted decision making process. For example, suppose you are investigating a new application and/or database for a mission critical job. Let’s also suppose your existing solution is working “good enough”. However, the industry pundits, bloggers and analysts are hyping and luring you towards the next big thing in technology. At this point, alarm bells should be ringing. Let’s explore why. First, for companies that are not start-ups, the idea of ripping and replacing an existing and working solution should give every CIO and CTO pause. The use cases enabled by this new technology must significantly stand out. Second, unless your existing solution is fully depreciated (for on-premises, hardware based solutions), you’re going to have a tough time getting past your CFO. Regardless of your situation, you’ll need compelling calculations for TCO, IRR and ROI. Third, you will need to investigate whether your company has the skill sets to develop and operate this new environment, or whether they are readily available from outside vendors. Fourth, consider your risk tolerance or appetite for failure—as in, if this new IT project fails—will it be considered a “drop in the bucket” or could it take down the entire company? Finally, consider whether you’re succumbing to technology zealotry pitched by your favorite vendor or internal technologist. Oftentimes in technology decision making, the better choice is “and”, not “either”.   For example, more companies are adopting a heterogeneous technology environment for unified information where multiple technologies and approaches work together in unison to meet various needs for reporting, dashboards, visualization, ad-hoc queries, operational applications, predictive analytics, and more. In essence, think more about synergies and inter-operability, not isolated technologies and processes. In counterpoint, some will argue that technology capabilities increasingly overlap, and with a heterogeneous approach companies might be paying for some features twice. It is true that lines are blurring regarding technology capabilities as some of today’s relational databases can accept and process JSON (previously the purview of NoSQL databases), queries and BI reports can run on Hadoop, and “discovery work” can complete on multiple platforms. However, considering the maturity and design of various competing big data solutions, it does not appear—for the immediate future—that one size will fit all. When it comes to selecting big data technologies, objectivity and flexibility are paramount. You’ll have to settle on technologies based on your unique business and use cases, risk tolerance, financial situation, analytic readiness and more.   If your big data vendor or favorite company technologist is missing a toolbox or multi-faceted perspective and instead seems to employ a “to a hammer, everything looks like a nail” approach, you might want to look elsewhere for a competing point of view. *Full disclosure: the author of this column is employed by Teradata Corporation.

The Technology Adoption Life Cycle Like it? 139 comments 0 Posted May 6, 2010 Keywords : enterprise technology , it projects , technology adoption life cycle (talc) I have spent time this week working on a new piece for Cutter on emerging technologies such as cloud computing and MDM. Interestingly, I returned to a tried and true concept: Technology Adoption Life Cycle (TALC). For those of you unfamiliar with TALC, Wikipedia defines it as a model that …describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or “bell curve.” The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called “innovators,” followed by “early adopters.” Next come the early and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called “laggards.” While enterprise technologies have certainly changed in my fifteen years of working with them, one question continues continues to intrigue me: Which type of organization is most likely to be on the left side of TALC? To simplify matters, I’ll place all organizations into three categories: The Struggling Organization The Self-Sufficient Organization The Adventurous Organization Note that economic conditions mean that all bets are off. Many successful organizations these days lack the funds for many desirable or even necessary technological improvements. The Struggling Organization Over the course of my career, I’ve had many discussions with people about the challenges that their organizations face implementing new systems and why so many projects failed to hit their marks. While by no means a definitive list, consider the following: the difficulty of gathering comprehensive system requirements during the discovery phase the dynamic nature of requirements the inevitable scope creep and resultant problems during IT projects Issues like these have plagued both organizations for years. What’s more, they continue to manifest themselves during many (if not most) major IT projects. As a result, organizations that have historically struggled with enterprise systems will rarely—if ever—be on the left of TALC. If anything, they are the very definition of laggards. The Self-Sufficient Organization Often I’ll assist organizations begrudgingly upgrading systems. In these cases, the motivation is clearly the stick, not the carrot. For these organizations, previous implementation issues and future enhancements to their apps just don’t matter now (as well as in the short- and mid-terms). These types of organizations are going live in a few weeks and the focus is very much on what needs to happen to continue paying employees, running financial reports, and the like. Only well after the dust settles will “future enhancements” be broached. In terms of TALC, organizations “getting by” are usually reluctant to take the lead on a new but largely untested technology. You’ll most likely find them in the early to late majority of TALC. The Adventurous Organization Then there are organizations that want to be on the leading edge–or perhaps need to be , based on some business reason. They have the following: sufficient financial resources sufficient human resources a “risk-tolerant” culture a compelling business need These organizations are more likely to implement a largely untested technology and be on the left side of TALC. As an added incentive, at times, software vendors are willing to work with “beta clients” by providing free or heavily discounted resources. In exchange, the vendor will be able to promote the product’s implementation as a successful case study. Conclusion Organizations that have had problems implementing and maintaining their systems tend not to be early adopters . In other words, financial, cultural, and political reasons place the vast majority of organizations squarely in the middle of the curve. When walking is a challenge, it’s hard to imagine running. Feedback What do you think? Are there are other reasons that organizations often take a “wait and see” approach? Photo from Wikipedia.

Enterprise 2.0 Pilots Like it? 107 comments 0 Posted June 8, 2010 Keywords : enterprise 2.0 (e2.0) , it projects , saas , CRM , Business Intelligence Andrew McAfee started an interesting discussion recently with his post Drop the Pilot . McAfee makes no bones about the fact that he isn’t a big fan of pilots for Enterprise 2.0 projects. Both in the comments and in subsequent posts by people like Phil Green , many have weighed in with their thoughts on these type of pilot projects. It’s high time for me to chime in. My Definition of Enterprise 2.0 Before continuing, a definition is in order. I don’t define E2.0 in the same way that McAfee does in his eponymous book or on his blog. McAfee’s definition largely focuses on collaboration and social software in the enterprise. I go a bit further. In The Next Wave of Technologies , I define Enterprise 2.0 a bit more broadly to include emerging technologies such as SOA, MDM, SaaS, clouds, BI, social networking, open source, and others. From my book’s first chapter : Simon Says: Context Matters As for the pros and cons of pilots, I understand both sides of the argument. Consider two extremes: Company X: A large and overly complex organization with a terrible history of managing IT projects, a dysfunctional culture, non-existent data governance, and other undesirable attributes. Company Y: A nimble startup with few hurdles, relatively good data, and a successful history of agile software development. How can one credibly make the claim that Company X should undertake even a small Enterprise 2.0 pilot? Let’s say that Company X wanted to move their apps and data over to the cloud. They would just be adding further complexity to their existing architecture. On the other hand, Company Y can probably jump in with both feet. These are two extremes and obviously most organizations and IT projects will fall in between them. Industry, type of application, organizational culture, risks, rewards, and other factors need to be considered before undertaking a pilot project. I hate to sound like a traditional consultant, but it depends on many variables. To me, an unequivocal stance makes little sense. Feedback What do you think?

Tell Me a Story Like it? 125 comments 0 Posted June 5, 2010 Keywords : information overload Link to original post. Photo from Linda Cronin I recently appeared on the New York Times’ Tech Talk podcast , answering a number of questions about emerging technologies. Now, all of these questions were squarely in my sweet spot. No one asked me to name the most famous 17th century French Philosopher . But there was one question that gave me more pause than the rest: What’s been the biggest change in technology over the last five years? Wow. So many technologies and developments, and I had to choose one. After some reflection, I went with “the massive explosion of content–legal and otherwise.” In other words, there’s just so much content and information out there that it’s often hard to determine what you need to be consuming. For more on this, check out my friend Jim Harris’ excellent post on filter failure and cognitive load . What’s more, this trend shows no signs of abating. If anything, we’re going to see even more content in the foreseeable future, especially given the announcement that self-publishing is moving directly to Kindles and iPads . I’ll be you $100 that Andrew Keen must be cringing over that one. Filter Failure vs. Information Overload Some have called this phenomenon information overload. Not Clay Shirky. In a recent talk , he explains: What we’re dealing with now is not the problem of information overload, because we’re always dealing (and always have been dealing) with information overload…Thinking about information overload isn’t accurately describing the problem; thinking about filter failure is. So, is Shirky right? I honestly have no idea. To quote Louis Armstrong , “You like potato and I like potahto.” I can only speak for myself. I like to think that I have pretty good filters. I only subscribe to and read the blogs that interest me. I’ll quickly put down a book that doesn’t do it for me. I no longer finish every one that I start. I’ll walk out of a movie even if I paid $13 to get in. Simon Says: It’s All About Stories How do I choose what to read–or keep reading? In a word, stories. My favorite writers are the ones that draw me in with interesting narratives, making their points without being preachy. Think Malcolm Gladwell . Would Outliers , for example, be as popular if Gladwell cited dry statistics about how success hinges just as much on luck as skill? No. But reading about how Bill Gates slaved away at terminals when computers were rare sticks with you  more than dry prose about the importance of hard work. To me, this seems obvious but this is hardly universal. For example, I recent picked up a short IT book devoid of case studies, stories, and examples. There was nothing wrong with the content and the author actually wrote solid prose in a welcoming style. But I couldn’t get through the book. I can only read so many pages of truisms and recommendations. After 60 pages, I thumbed through the remaining chapters, looking for anecdotes. I couldn’t find any and put the book down, probably for good. In my own articles, posts, and books, I try to tell stories that convey larger points and messages. At least in the non-fiction world, I believe that it’s the best way to communicate, retain reader interest, and rise about today’s din.

You can probably find thousands of similar posts that cover the same ground. Some of them are probably even pretty well written. At the same time, though, I felt the need to write it for one reason: Quite frankly, there are quite a few people and organizations stuck in the technological ice ages. Let me explain what I mean. A few weeks ago, I joined a local Chamber of Commerce with the typical expectations: to network and meet potential partners and clients. As is the norm at networking events, I exchange handshakes and business cards with established business owners from many different industries. After I return home, invariably I’ll go to these companies’ sites and give them a quick once-over. To be sure, some organizations’ sites are more visually appealing and social media-friendly than others. At their worst, I have seen some sites that are completely non-interactive relics of the mid-1990s. For the purposes of this post, let’s call them 90s Sites. 90s Sites You know the type of sites that I’m talking about. They all have the standard pages: Home About Products and/or Services Contact Testimonials Now, there’s nothing wrong with 90s Sites per se . It’s just that they could be more. So much more. Anyone can quickly scan 90s Sites within two minutes. Most important, there’s no reason for coming back. Ever. 90s Sites are essentially glorified brochures. Think about it. As Chris Brogan points out in this video for ABC news , you don’t buy magazines for the ads. You don’t watch TV for the commercials. Deficiencies What specifically are 90s Sites lacking? Forget aesthetics for a moment. Give me a bare bones site with valuable content over a pretty brochure any day of the week and twice on Sunday. My friend Jim Harris’ site is the antithesis of the term “cluttered”, but it’s easy to navigate and devoid of superfluous “stuff.” I like to think that my own site strikes that balance as well. These days, whether your organization does mortgages or legal services, it needs to have the following items on its site: An integrated blog within the main site. Why you’d send someone away from your main site to a separate blog is beyond me. Meaningful and well-written posts. You don’t have to blog every day, but to me once per month is simply not enough. Social media icons for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter and other ways to connect and share information. Ways to subscribe to content (which is a bit irrelevant since 90s Sites really provide no reason to subscribe). Multimedia content such as videos or podcasts. This doesn’t mean that a lawyer divulges the specifics of her case on her blog. Nor should a mortgage company explain specifically why they rejected me. I’m talking about general tips, pieces of advice, or articles rife with valuable information. In a phrase: meaningful content coupled with common sense. Benefits Again, in all likelihood, if you’re reading this post, I’m probably preaching to the choir here. For those skeptics, however, “getting with the program” will result in the following: Increased Alexa and Google Page ranks Increased traffic and, quite possibly, inquires for products and services Increased information about your customer base Increased stickiness and time on site Increased “buzz” Decreased bounce rate Increased probability of additional business. Note that I’ll never make the cause-effect argument here. I could go on, but to me the pros outweigh the cons here by an order of magnitude. My fundamental question is, “Would you go to your site and stick around?” Common Excuses So, in keeping with one of my new year’s resolutions to “get out from behind the computer” more, I’ve had coffee with a number of these folks. Over the course of the discussion, we’ll talk about social media, the Internet, and blogging. So, what’s preventing these organizations from making the jump? The usual suspects are: I don’t understand social media. Social media is a waste of time. Social media is fad. I don’t have the time. I wouldn’t know where to start. It’s not my job to do social media. It probably costs a great deal of money to redo a website. I can’t refute every objection here but, suffice it to so, it’s not that hard to blog once in a while and add social media integration. Content management systems such as WordPress are not terribly difficult to install and manage. Simon Says If you think that the web is going to revert to an erstwhile time, then I have some beepers that I’d like to sell you. I’m a big believer that, if you believe that something is valuable, then you’ll find the time and resources to do it. What’s stopping you? Link to original post.

How Enterprise 2.0 Will Enable the Semantic Web Like it? 268 comments 0 Posted May 10, 2010 Keywords : cloud computing , enterprise 2.0 , semantic web As I write this, I am nearly finished with the best and most challenging book that I have read in years. The book is Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web to Transform Your Business by David Siegel. I couldn’t wait to finish it before posting about it. What is the semantic web? You may not be familiar with the semantic web. Six months ago, I sure wasn’t. So let’s get the definition out of the way. According to Wikipedia, it is an evolving development of the World Wide Web in which the meaning ( semantics ) of information and services on the web is defined, making it possible for the web to “understand” and satisfy the requests of people and machines to use the web content . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It derives from World Wide Web Consortium director Sir Tim Berners-Lee ’s vision of the Web as a universal medium for data , information , and knowledge exchange. Some have referred to the semantic web as Web 3.0. While perhaps a decade away by some estimates, such as a recent report by Pew Research , thousands of people are working right now on making it a reality. Examples The industries and examples covered in Siegel’s book run the gamut. Relatively recent ones such as search will be transformed, as will more established ones such as the law. Consider the latter for a moment. With the semantic web and personal data lockers , contracts may be automatically updated when one or more parties changes states. For example, let’s say that I have an agreement to sell oranges to a supermarket in New York City. I decided to take my business to Ohio and, as a result, my contract will tell me if I need to apply for different licenses. (Yes, you read right.) Paperwork will be filed automatically with the appropriate agencies in my new state. Any work required by lawyers will involve actual legal interpretation and analysis, not administrative activities for which I’m being grossly overcharged. Sound far-fetched? Perhaps. But it’s coming and it’s going to change the web as we know it, not to mention how we work and live. Siegel also cites the failure of many “knowledge management” systems. Most were, at best, ultimately incomplete for one simple reason: they depended upon typically overworked people entering updates and information into them. That’s hardly a recipe for success. The solution is the concept of an ontology , something enabled by the semantic web. At a high level, an ontology automates the learning process for systems, allowing for a comprehensive and commonly understood set of assumptions, facts, and descriptions. This obviates the need for anyone to manually update projects and repositories of information. Using ontologies takes care of that for us. Enterprise 2.0 How does all of this fit in with Enterprise 2.0? What do cloud computing, SaaS, social media, and the like have to do with the semantic web? Long story short: Enterprise 2.0 technologies will free people and organizations from the shackles of often less-than-valuable activities. Let’s say that an organization begins using a cloud or SaaS provider for its applications, freeing it from the burden of maintaining them. For example, let’s say that application patches and upgrades are now handled by Amazon’s cloud offering. The cost savings allow that organization to hire employees–or redeploy existing ones–for much more valuable activities. For example, imagine if a company (call it Acme) transformed its applicant tracking systems to embrace the hresume microformat. Rather than relying on simple and often ineffective keyword searches to find applicants who may or may not meet their needs, recruiters hiring managers would be automatically alerted when much more qualified applicants announce their availability to the world. What’s more, that information is automatically and accurately imported into Acme’s systems, allowing for future matches based on changing business needs. Conclusion The semantic web is going to be a game changer. We’ll have to go through Web 2.0 to get to Web 3.0 first. Stay tuned. Of course, that’s just my opinion. What do you think?

Technology Today, #20: David Siegel and The Semantic Web Like it? 102 comments 0 Posted May 13, 2010 Keywords : data security , privacy , semantic web After a bit of a respite, Technology Today is back. I read quite a bit about emerging technologies. Rarely, however, will I have to put down a book and attempt to process the gravity of what I have just read. I recently had that experience multiple times while reading Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web to Transform Your Business by David Siegel . I wrote about the semantic web a little while ago. Pull is an amazing book with far-reaching implications for organizations, people, and business in general. I this podcast, I speak with the book’s author about questions such as: What exactly is the semantic web? What’s the deal with changing from push to pull? Isn’t that already happening? What do you mean by “personal data locker” and why is it so important? How do you see the adoption of the semantic web over the next five years or so? What are the implications for Apple? What should CIOs know about all this? Isn’t it too early for practical solutions? David has also generously agreed to give away a copy of his most recent book if you find an Easter egg on his site .

As global barriers break down, so will the power that the US has held for so many years. Technology is becoming the great equalizer. While the US GDP was three times that of China just last year, China is expected to match the US in this next decade. Just this year, it surpassed Japan to be the world's second largest economy. As it becomes easier to build facilities in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging markets, the US and it's labor force are going to need to retool to remain competitive on a global scale. Many US companies have already realized they cannot claim \"made 100% in the USA\" and stay in business anymore.

The Myth of Multiple Intelligences: Its Impact on eLearning Like it? 180 comments 0 Posted June 11, 2015 Keywords : Software When you were in grade school, you probably heard about the theory of multiple intelligences. Developed by psychologist Dr. Howard Gardner in the early 1980s, the theory states that different individuals learn best in different ways: For example, one student by be a verbal learner who prefers to listen and write, while another student may be a kinesthetic learner who requires interaction to gain valuable information. This theory makes sense; after all, people are often different from one another, demonstrating unique habits and interests. Over the years, educators have adapted their teaching styles to accommodate the various learning styles, costing thousands of hours of work and millions of dollars. It is unfortunate, then, that Dr. Gardner’s theory is patently false. Why the Theory of Multiple Intelligences Is Wrong Since Dr. Gardner put forth his theory three decades ago, researchers throughout the sciences, from neurology to sociology, have endured countless thousands of studies attempting to prove the concept correct. Unfortunately, most were unable to find any correlation between improved academic performance and tailored modes of instruction. Plenty of individuals harbor preferences for learning; when asked, more than 95 percent of people claim to learn better after taking in the information in a particular way. However, the science shows that learning through one’s preferred style is no indication that an individual will understand and retain the information any better. The fact is that learning is a complex process, and there are thousands of variables that affect how an individual gathers knowledge. Teachers must consider their students’ backgrounds, personalities, interests, motivations, and more in order to create a valuable and effective lesson plan. Asking that teachers also cater to individual students’ learning styles is making the system even more complex and needlessly wasting energy and resources. How eLearning Has Already Adopted the Theory The theory of multiple intelligences is a pervasive one, which means many instructional designers believe in learning styles automatically. As a result, many eLearning systems integrate the theory into the design of their courses, attempting to serve at least the most popular styles (audio, visual, kinetic) with alternate activities and projects designed to engage particular learners. ELearning hasn’t been the only educational industry to be duped by the myth of multiple intelligences. Instructional designers and teachers alike are drawn in by for-profit organizations peddling personality evaluations that reveal students’ learning styles. These companies usually also sell example lesson plans that accommodate various learners in various subjects. Such services are expensive and unnecessary, and they usually waste students’ time instead of helping them grow. What Instructional Designers Can Do About It Though advanced degrees are not always necessary to succeed in the eLearning field, plenty of instructional designers who return to school benefit from instruction in the industry’s current trends . Most academics understand the irrelevance of the multiple intelligences theory, and thus, most programs teach instructional designers how to create excellent online courses without worrying about learning styles. Still, it may be valuable to consider the importance of different instructional methods. Not every subject can and should be taught the same way. Either by the nature of the content or the ease with which it is conveyed, certain subjects simply must employ differing teaching styles. For example, studying literature requires verbal skills, and learning a skilled trade requires physical involvement. These styles often seem strikingly similar to the learning styles that are discernably false: interpersonal, kinesthetic, visual, mathematical etc. However, unlike learning styles, teaching styles are shown to have a positive effect. When designing courses, instructional designers should evaluate the material and select the most sensible teaching method to ensure their eLearning students gain the most benefit. In 1980, Dr. Gardner said “The potential utility of computers in the process of matching individuals to modes of instruction is substantial.” Though Gardner is likely incorrect regarding individuals’ learning styles, he was notably ahead of his time in predicting the power of eLearning. Today, more and more courses are moving online; not only do universities and community colleges increasingly provide all-online degree programs to busy workers looking to improve, but high schools and lower education levels are moving to the Web. Thus, it is becoming ever-more essential for instructional designers to thoroughly understand where, why, and how students learn. Better Planning And Utilization Of Inventory . Dynamic rules, policies, and predictions for inventory management lead to more accurate tracking and estimation of consumption and inventory levels at all points along the supply chain. This can be done with updates to your barcode printers and scanners and a better EPOS system for instance.

Common Ground: Solving the Survey-GIS Gap Like it? 115 comments 0 Posted November 29, 2016 Keywords : Mobility , Data Warehousing , Data Quality , Modeling , Software , Collaborative Data We’ve all heard the decades-old phrase surveyors have used to describe GIS: “Get It Surveyed.” But the saying, which emerged based on deep-rooted perceptions, overlooks the overlap and similar functions of the surveying and GIS fields. In fact, the disciplines are closely related. The crossover between the two offers significant opportunities for cooperation and information exchange as well as professional growth. Surveying and GIS both provide answers to the same basic questions: “Where is it?” “What is it?” “How does it relate to things around it?” “What about it is interesting or important?” And they both seek to address the most important question: “How can I get the information to people who need it?” So, given the similarities, why the gap, be it real or perceived? Both disciplines use positions and attributes as primary data. But their data acquisition is based on a differing emphasis on precision. Surveyors focus on precise measurement and positioning, while GIS requires detail and precision in descriptions and attributes. GIS attributes have little value without positions, and precise survey locations are nearly always accompanied by some sort of descriptive information. Instead of a gap, it’s actually a complementary situation. Meeting User Needs It’s intriguing to note that in many cases the push to close the gap comes from clients and end users of GIS data. They are learning that increased precision in positioning can make their geospatial information more valuable and useful. For example, locating a water shutoff valve during a Minnesota winter often involves digging through snow and ice. If the valve location is known only to within a meter or so, the field crew needs to dig a large hole—a difficult and time-consuming task. But with decimeter or even centimeter precision, the crew can find the valve more quickly. Consumers of GIS data also want more than 2D drawings. The ability to produce 3D deliverables with comprehensive attributes makes accuracy and precision a valued asset in many enterprises. However, traditional GIS technicians may lack the skills and equipment (high-precision GNSS and optical instruments) needed to produce centimeter accuracy. As more GIS users understand the benefits that come with survey accuracy, they are turning to surveyors to gather data destined for GIS applications. At first glance, this seems like a win-win situation, with more work for surveyors and better data for GIS. But many surveyors are not trained to collect the information that would satisfy the GIS core need for detailed data. Missing information can result in costly revisits and doesn’t help to close the survey-GIS gap. What’s needed is a way to tighten the interaction between data acquisition and data management and analysis. Building Bridges There are two ways to solve the problem. In one approach, survey-grade positioning solutions such as the Trimble ®  R1 or R2 GNSS receivers can be tied into the GIS workflow. This method simplifies the process of gathering decimeter (or better) positions and can be used by GIS professionals. By using software development kits or configurable solutions such as Trimble TerraFlex ™  software, users can blend precise positions with GIS workflows and attribute collection. The approach lends itself well to consumer-grade handhelds and a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) philosophy. A second approach calls on the surveyor to gain specific knowledge about the information used in the GIS. This can best be accomplished by delving directly into the GIS database and creating workflows that capture all of the necessary data. For example, Trimble Business Center software can connect to an Esri database and extract object data and schema. This information can be used to automatically create the code libraries used by field surveyors with Trimble Access™ software. Then, when the field crew calls up a code for a specific feature, the associated attribute details guide the surveyor in gathering all the needed information. Aside from collecting additional attributes, the surveyor can operate within his or her existing workflows. While matching survey feature codes to GIS needs isn’t new, the ability to automatically create feature codes from GIS schema is a significant step. A GIS database may have thousands of different features, each with a dozen or more attributes. Connecting directly to the database can save days or weeks of manual work to define feature codes and prevent errors or inconsistencies in definitions. The link to the GIS database continues on the back end as well. When the survey field data returns to Trimble Business Center it is reviewed for accuracy and adjusted as necessary. Then, a single command writes the new survey data directly to the GIS database. When the GIS user refreshes the map in the ArcMap environment, all of the new data is there and ready for use. In addition to bypassing the usual process of exporting from one package and importing to another, the GIS approach used by Trimble Business Center removes many of the challenges faced by surveyors unaccustomed to collecting such rich attribute information. Each feature, together with its complete attributes and survey metadata are available in the GIS database. As the industry evolves, the gap will continue to narrow. Surveyors should expect to be asked to provide more GIS-ready data. By adopting tools that allow survey solutions and workflows to interact directly with complex GIS databases, geospatial professionals can replace the gap with new business opportunities.

Data Mining Interview: Meta Brown Like it? 99 comments 0 Posted April 30, 2012 Keywords : Analytics , Culture/Leadership , Data Mining Meta Brown, General Manager of Analytics at LinguaSys, has kindly accepted to answer a few questions for Data Mining Research. I would like to thank Meta for her time and her advices in Analytics. Data Mining Research: Who are you and what is your story? Meta Brown: I’m a practical, plain-talking data analyst and engineer.  I use data to tell true stories, and teach others to do the same. So many of my clients do worthwhile things I could not do myself – improve medical care, provide valuable social services, create and sell useful products – that it is my pleasure to help each of them find ways to work a little better (or a lot) through analytics. DMR: What services do you offer as a consultant in analytics? MB: Guidance for organizations initiating or expanding analytics programs. Analytics only improves your bottom line if you begin with a realistic plan for making that happen. My role is to help you create and act on that plan, beginning with identification of goals and working backwards to define the steps you must take to meet those goals. This is an empowerment process that leaves your organization stronger, and more independent. My availability for consulting is limited now, as my primary role is General Manager of Analytics at LinguaSys, a language technology firm. My work there is all about the coolest in text analytics. DMR: What is the most important thing you have learned as a consultant in analytics? MB: Consulting is valuable to those who are open to changing what they do. Others are wasting their money. Consultants have expertise, the ability to offer valuable information and advice, but only clients have the power to act on that input. Advice that is merely good, but executed brilliantly, yields far more value than brilliant advice without action. DMR: What advice would you give to a business analytics manager? MB: Set goals based on the primary concerns of decision makers, and make certain that most of your goals are things you’re sure you can do well and on time. Break up big goals into bite-size goals, and document your success as you go. This ensures survival, and leaves a little room for risk.

Forecasting: standard methods Like it? 116 comments 0 Posted September 17, 2012 Keywords : forecasting To continue the first post of a series on forecasting, let’s discuss standard methods used for predicting time series. The two firsts methods can be used as benchmark for comparing with more advances models: Mean value: the mean of the time series used for training is used as the forecast for all values in the test time series. Last value: the last value of the time series is used as the forecast for the next one. Simple Moving Average (SMA): the last m values are averaged to predict the next one. Weighted Moving Average (WMA): the last m values are averaged, with a more important weight for recent values, to predict the next one. Other approaches exist such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA), ARIMA, Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Do you use other techniques for forecasting? Which one is better according to your experience?

Forecasting: Evaluation Criteria Like it? 161 comments 0 Posted October 16, 2012 Keywords : Predictive Analytics To continue our series on forecasting , let’s discuss one of the varying factors: the evaluation criteria. In classification, the percentage of accuracy is often used. It is obvious and easy to interpret. In the case of regression (e.g. forecasting), this is more complex. Whatever the application and the prediction method used, at one point, performances need to be evaluated. One motivation to evaluate results is to choose the most appropriate forecasting algorithm. Another one is to avoid overfitting. Thus, choosing the right criterion for your problem is a key step. In this post, we will focus on three accuracy measures. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is certainly the most used measure. It is mainly due to its simplicity and usage in other domains. Its equation is given below: The main drawback of RMSE is to be scale dependent. It is thus not possible to compare two different time series. The second one is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). It is scale independent: Its main issue is to be undefined when the denominator is null. This may happen often with intermittent data. The third error measure is the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). The naïve forecast (last value) can be used as the denominator: The measure is scale independent and if below 1, better than naïve forecast (a good benchmark). What error measure do you use and why?

Data Mining Book Review: Dance with Chance Like it? 112 comments 0 Posted November 5, 2012 Keywords : Predictive Analytics If you ever worked on time series prediction (forecasting), you should read Dance with Chance. It is written by  a statistician, a psychologist and a decision scientist (Makriddakis, Hogarth and Gaba). As it is the case in The Numerati or Super Crunchers , authors explain complex notions to a non-expert audience. I find the book really interesting and provocative. The main concept of Dance with Chance is the “illusion of control”. It is when you think you control a future event or situation, that is in fact mainly due to chance. This is the opposite of fatalism (when you think you have no control, although you have). The book teaches how to avoid being fooled by this illusion of control. This is a very interesting reading for any data miner, particularly involved with forecasting. The books contains dozens of examples of the limitation of forecasting techniques. For example, it explains the issues of forecasting the stock market and when predictions are due to chance. Authors use a brilliant mix of statistics and psychology to prove their point. Of course, it is difficult for someone in the field to completely agree with the authors. For example, they often state that no one can predict the future in advance. Formulated this way, one may agree. However, data mining and machine learning techniques are able to predict future situations (based on past data) to a certain extent (probabilities). Another bias of the authors is their tendency to reject complex models simply because…they are complex. Although I know the famous Occam’s razor, advanced and complex techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) have proven their efficiency in several applications. To conclude, whether you agree or not with the authors, Dance with Chance open your eyes on the illusion of control and thus on the limitations of predictive algorithms.

IIoT Benefits & Security Considerations for Sensor-2-Server Like it? 86 comments 0 Posted November 30, 2016 Keywords : Security , Predictive Analytics , Big Data , IT From a technology partnership perspective, Big Data vendors face the challenge of comparing data in motion versus data at rest. If the data has already moved through a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and has been aggregated, changed, stalled, or is not quite granular enough, it can be difficult to deliver high-value predictive analytics. The concept of predictive analytics is that an operator can make an accurate estimate that certain things can happen during operations. However, the operator needs to determine what the drivers are for the predicted actions to happen and must look at active data to determine if this is, in fact, happening. Without insight into the active data in motion, they are lacking an essential piece of the predictive analytics. This ability to compare data in motion at the access layer could benefit Big Data vendors when it comes to predictive analytics because it allows them to give higher value to their customers, which drives additional revenue. With S2S technology, they can deploy a tiered application infrastructure that allows data to intelligently move from one point to another. A Sensor-2-Server (S2S) strategy also enables operators to go beyond a legacy SCADA data network. To operate a SCADA network, it requires a lot of institutional knowledge to truly understand, manage and work within the environment. S2S expands beyond moving the data into SCADA systems and allows operators to leverage more advanced technology, like predictive analytics. Essentially, S2S communications provide the opportunity to take advantage of new advanced tools, but the operator doesn’t necessarily have to sacrifice the institutional knowledge built into the SCADA data systems. As new generations enter the workforce, it’s likely that there will be a shift and some of that institutional knowledge will be replaced with technology that will allow operators to do more than they ever could before. The addition of new technology and IoT networks is where operators are starting to see the functional lines blur between the IT and production groups. As more technology is leveraged, these two disparate groups will have to work together more often. There is now a drive for a more holistic picture of what is going on in IT, what is going on in the field, and whether the technology used will be compatible with future needs. SCADA will likely always have value for industrial communications but, going forward, there will be an increase in the use other technologies as well. Additionally, with more technology physically in the field, there is always going to be a focus on data security. Security Sensors at the access layer present interesting security challenges. For example, consider a data concentrator sitting on an oil pad that is collecting data. This device is collecting data from a number of sensors and has data logging capabilities, which also means the other devices sitting at the remote site contain historical data. Technology providers need to ensure that the technology used is taking advantage of all the security features that are available to make sure their data is protected through a variety of means including encryption, authentication, virus and intrusion protection, and by being physically tamperproof. With the growing interest in IIoT, the system is providing a communication path with highly valuable information. These sensors may be running an application on the edge of the network, and many of these devices are using IP. When there are Ethernet and IP devices going out to edge devices in the field, each one of those devices has the potential to become a threat to the entire corporate network if they’re not secure. Operators in IIoT environments need to be concerned with everything that could be introduced to the network at every single connection point. Data protection data is a fundamental and extremely important element in determining the effectiveness of S2S communication. Technology vendors must be mindful of security in every step of the design and installation process, and operators must require security features that will protect their data and networks. In addition to data security, the threat to physical infrastructures in very remote locations is driving the need for new security solutions such as intelligent video surveillance designed to maximize security and minimize cost. S2S solutions need to be physically capable of delivering the bandwidth to enable these new solutions. Where Do We Go From Here? Industrial communication is changing in the sense that IIoT enables the possibility for every device in a network to be connected – including those in the outer access layer. This has created a convergence of OT and IT operations in many instances or – at the very least – has brought the two departments to a closer working capacity. IoT and technology at the access layer enable the option for Sensor-2-Server, a form of intelligent communications that can move the sensor data to a specific server for detailed analysis. New data and technology are allowing operators to do things they’ve never done before, such as predictive analytics. As this shift continues, SCADA is not becoming an obsolete technology; rather it will become a piece in the bigger technology picture. Any operator choosing S2S technology, or any technology for that matter, must carefully consider the options and keep security as a top priority.

Analytics, Semantics & Sense: Q&A with Elliot Turner, AlchemyAPI Like it? 318 comments 0 Posted April 29, 2014 Keywords : Analytics , Text Analytics , Sentiment Analytics , Unstructured Data I recently posted an article,  Metadata, Connection, and the Big Data Story , covering the big-data analysis process as applied to \"human data\" that is communicated in  intentionally expressive  sources such as text, video, and social  like s and  share s and in implicit expressions of sentiment. The article is spun out from Q&A interview of four industry figures:  Fernando Lucini  (HP Autonomy),  Marie Wallace  (IBM),  Elliot Turner  (AlchemyAPI), and  Stephen Pulman  (University of Oxford and TheySay). (AlchemyAPI is sponsoring my up-coming market study, \"Text Analytics 2014: User Perspectives on Solutions and Providers.\") Read each interview by clicking or tapping on the name of the interviewee. This interview is -- Analytics, Semantics & Sense: Q&A with Elliot Turner, AlchemyAPI 1) What's the really interesting information content that we're not really getting at yet, and what's interesting about it? Companies always want to know what consumers will buy and when they will buy it. But Intent Mining is still in its infancy.  Today, it is easy to classify the topics and sentiment of an individual post, or roll up how Twitter feels about the top entities extracted from a real-time hashtag feed.  The performance of these classification and ranking processes will get better, but they are just first components of future solutions that seek to predict an individual’s purchasing behavior.  Success in this task will combine other elements like a person’s interests, relationships, geography - and ultimately their identity, purchase history and privacy preferences - so that applications can plot where a person is in their \"buyer's journey\" and provide the best offers at the best times. Going beyond text, other areas for big progress are in the mining of audio, speech, images and video.  These are interesting because of their incredible growth. For example, we will soon see over 1 billion photos/day taken and shared from the world’s camera phones. Companies with roots in unsupervised deep-learning techniques should be able to leverage their approaches to dramatically improve our ability to correctly identify the content contained in image data. 2) How well are we doing with Natural Language Processing, noting that formally, \"processing\" includes both understanding and generation, two parts of a conversation? Google has trained us to search using keywords, and this won't change overnight. But the trend is easy to spot: the interactive question-answering capabilities made famous by IBM's Watson will become commonplace, offered at a fraction of today’s costs and made available as easy-to-integrate web services. The goal of interactive search is to let us get faster answers to the detailed questions we ask every day. Early, mass adopters of new Question Answering applications include large support organizations with complex products where the entire business model can be improved with faster time-to-answer. As interactive Question Answering systems move beyond professional analysts we will see search and retrieval transform to become dialog-based and be highly aware of an ongoing context - machines will \"stay in conversation\" and not treat each search as a unique event, but encourage ad-hoc drill down or expansion of answers already obtained. 3) And how well are we able to mine and automate understanding of affective states, of mood, emotion, attitudes, and intent, in the spectrum of sources available to us? Work is on-going to move beyond a binary classification of sentiment to identifying richer emotional states, and applying these results to the best way a company should engage an individual.  But gaining a deeper, more valuable understanding of an individual’s  intent , and tying this intent to the specific call-to-action a company could make, are big tasks that are just getting off the ground. A never-ending challenge to understanding text is staying current with emerging slang and phrases. Unsupervised learning can enable machines to discover new words without human-curated training sets. 4) Deep learning, active learning, or maybe some form of machine learning that's being cooked up in a research lab: What business benefits are delivered by these technologies, and what are the limits to their usefulness, technical or other? Few NLP companies are truly deploying deep learning methods, even though deep learning can give us a much richer representation of text than is possible with traditional NLP approaches. Deep learning can produce more robust text and vision systems that hold their accuracy when analyzing data far different from what they were trained on.  Plus, unsupervised techniques make it practical to keep up with the rapid evolution of everyday language.  Did you know that 15 percent of the daily queries submitted to Google - over 500 million - have never been seen before by Google's search engine? And this rate of previously unknown phrases is unchanged in the past 15 years? The ability to understand today’s short, jargon-filled phrases, and keep up with tomorrow’s new words, are predicated on mastering unsupervised, deep learning approaches. With respect to limitations, unsupervised deep learning isn’t magic. It isn't cheap or easy, either. It first requires some new skills for driving continued innovation in machine learning. Second, we need massive training data sets in order to build hierarchical representations of data without human involvement. In fact, we believe AlchemyAPI's algorithms are trained on data corpora  orders of magnitude larger  than most competitive solutions.  Finally, processing all of this information at such huge scale requires technical innovations all their own, coupled with significant amounts of affordable computing power. Thankfully, all  these limitations are being addressed today to help bring about the next generation of intelligent machines. 5) Mobile's growth is only accelerating, complicating the data picture, accompanied by a desire for faster, more accurate, and more useful, situational insights delivery. How is your company keeping up? Almost overnight, Mobile has enabled an explosion in image capture to where we will soon surpass 1 billion photos taken and shared each day. AlchemyAPI is investing heavily in computer vision technologies used to help machines quickly understand the content of all these photos in order to drive a host of new commerce, content and social applications. Response time is perhaps THE critical driver for mobile applications. Our obsession with speed of results and low latency through our cloud infrastructure leads to AlchemyAPI being consistently chosen over competitors whenever NLP-based applications require near real-time processing of unstructured data.    6) Where does the greatest opportunity reside, for your company as a solution provider? Internationalization? Algorithms, visualization, or other technical advances? In data integration and synthesis and expansion to new data sources? In monetizing data, that is, yourselves, or via partners, or assisting your customers? In untapped business domains or in greater uptake in the domains you already serve? Today, AlchemyAPI is the world’s most popular text analysis cloud service.  Our obsession with speed and accuracy of our results has resulted in being selected by designers of innovative, near real-time NLP applications to process billions documents each month.  We will continue to advance our algorithms while adding new deep learning-based features including a new classifier, a computer vision API and advanced question-answering solutions. Our greatest opportunity is to provide development teams a programmable Internet platform that makes it easy for their companies to create and deploy NLP applications in the cloud. The Alchemy platform can include built-in data sources, NLP functionality, storage of results, data analysis and reporting. Customer apps will run on a secure service that scales, tunes, and backs up data automatically. Over time, visual tools, sample UIs and our library of components can minimize custom coding and streamline the assembly of NLP apps using a building-block approach. These apps then integrate easily into a customer’s product lines and business systems using open APIs. 7) Anything to add, regarding the 2014 outlook for analytical and semantic and sensemaking technologies? Being a provider of NLP-based Web services gives AlchemyAPI a unique market perspective.  We help our customers build new applications that serve nearly every industry vertical and run on every computing device.  Because we are a subscription service, AlchemyAPI is also able to get a sense of which applications are succeeding and how fast they are growing. What we see leads us to this conclusion: despite our industry's penchant for hype, there is an arms race brewing in NLP-driven applications and we see 2014 as a year where much more of this energy moves from experimentation to building and deploying new apps into production. Two types of businesses we talk to every day include large public companies who are exploring how to incorporate modern text analysis capabilities into their established product lines. The second type are innovative startups who are charging at full speed with business plans aimed squarely at disrupting the established order.  It’s this second group that's adding excitement to our industry.  They are intent on making inroads into business intelligence, customer support, advertising and publishing, sales and marketing automation, enterprise search and many other markets. They won't all make it, but they are generating a lot of new interest, a lot of new customers, and forcing everyone to innovate faster. Thank you to Elliot!

Clarabridge Gets Engaged: A Report from the Customer Connections Conference Like it? 455 comments 0 Posted May 20, 2014 Keywords : Text Analytics , Sentiment Analytics , Social Media Analytics The Clarabridge Customer Connections (C3) conference has gotten to be a thing for me. There can't be more than a handful of people, beyond company co-founder and CEO Sid Banerjee and me, who have attended all six C3s, dating back to the fall of 2008. The conference name reflects what the company does: Clarabridge facilitates customer connections for its own corporate clients. C3 themes have evolved over the years, tracking Clarabridge's shift away from self-identifying as technology provider and toward a business-solutions focus. In a 2008 C3 release , Clarabridge proclaimed itself \"the leading provider of text analytics software [for] customer experience management (CEM).\" This year, I don't believe I heard even one use of the term \"text analytics\" in the company's conference presentations. Instead, customer experience and the customer journey occupied center stage, as they have for several years ( my 2010 C3 reporting ), expanding this year to a broadened message. CEO Sid said it this way: \"We've crossed the chasm from measurement to engagement.\" Surely, the (re-)defining moment took place April 8, just weeks before C3, when Clarabridge announced its acquisition of Market Metrix , \"the leading Enterprise Feedback Management (EFM) platform for the hospitality and gaming industries.\" (EFM is a fancy name for survey systems for customer service and satisfaction, market research, and employee engagement.) Clarabridge's journey hasn't been completely linear, however. C3's big theme for 2013 was Intelligent Customer Experience. A year ago, Sid said , \"ICE is really about integrating all the content, from all the sources, and applying intelligence to the multichannel content.\" This year? No mention of Intelligent Customer Experience at C3, and the term is hidden away in nooks on the company's Web site. I infer that while analytical intelligence -- the ability to discover relevant insights in data -- is necessary, it's not a market differentiator. Indeed, in a briefing for analysts, Sid talked about two types of CEM company, those with text analytics, and those that are seeking to add the technology to their portfolios. My take-away is that Clarabridge is competing on factors other than tool intelligence. The differentiators I see, and hear about from users, include ease-of-use, business-function and industry adaptation, and the ability to serve as a data hub via easy import of data from survey and social analytics tools. Yet Clarabridge's evolution, accelerated by the Market Metrix acquisition, puts Clarabridge on a competitive collision course with partners that include Confirmit and Verint. And sometimes those partners' own steps put them in competition with Clarabridge, for instance, Verint, with its January 2014 acquisition of Kana , and the ever-tightening integration of social-intelligence platform Radian6 into Salesforce Marketing Cloud . Yet there are always new, complementary partners to develop, notably social-intelligence vendor Sysomos  and speech-analysis provider Voci Technologies . The Voci partnership, by the way, will surely further test the Clarabridge-Verint partnership. The Sysomos link-up should last longer, so long as the companies operate in different spheres, noting that like Clarabridge, Sysomos has its own, robust natural-language processing technology. These partnerships are most often about data. A given customer will license software and services from multiple providers, and each system -- each \"touchpoint\" or \"channel\" -- generates data. In an \"omni-channel\" world, technology overlap is tolerable when the customers demand that their providers play nice (the Confirmit case), or the providers don't (yet) compete (Clarabridge and Sysomos and also OpinionLab ). Consider the case of insurer Travelers, represented at C3 by Chief Customer Officer Henry Edinger, who works in a dynamic environment where \"customer insights are everywhere,\" where \"everywhere\" encompasses the leading social platforms and also solution/data providers Confirmit, Qualtrics , J.D. Power , and Lieberman Research Worldwide  in addition to Clarabridge. Edinger spoke at C3 about an \"outside-in approach,\" where customer perceptions, interactions, and emotions create the customer experience. Analysis delivers insight but isn't strictly by-the-numbers. Edinger described Travelers' rewriting customer correspondence, replacing lawyer-crafted gems such as \"I am writing to confirm that I will be handling the above referenced auto claim\" with text that is such to be more-welcome to customers, \"It was a pleasure speaking with you...\" Other Clarabridge customer, partner, and analyst presentations provided quite interesting, complementary industry insights. On the best practices side, Jeff Mango talked about looking to Voice of the Customer data collection and analysis to surface problems, and Voice of the Employee for answers. Makes sense. Human judgment rules, even in the big data era, and human employees will understand customers in ways that machines can't. Jeff also talked about the omni-channel challenge, the desire to know and link everything said everywhere. At Verizon, \"we look at the right data sources at the right time, because we have 50.\" You can't do it all, all the time. But my favorite thought of Jeff's was his linking customer business value and emotion . The business value of sentiment, opinion, and emotion has been a focus of my work  for several years now. Another affirmation, for my 12 years in text analytics, was hearing Liz Spencer and Elizabeth Rector of Cisco describe how bringing results from customer satisfaction text analyses into their propensity-to-buy models led to a $5 million yearly sales gain, from that one, focused effort. C3 did feature several partner presentations, from solution-provider partners and also from professional-service partners. It's notable that the roster of Clarabridge service partners has expanded. Accenture  has been on board for a few years, more recently joined by Acumen Solutions  -- information management lead Dave Marko is a Clarabridge alumnus; check out his 2013 C3 report -- and this year, the W2O Group . W2O's Paul Dyer gave an interesting C3 presentation on Social Voice of the Customer. Dyer talked about a \"complex ecosystem\" of listening, filtering, and analysis solutions, built on tiers of data sources and suppliers, the latter including Gnip , DataSift , and Topsy . He offered the view that \"software-enabled people\" provide the best enterprise response to marketing challenges, and he described the emergence of \"social intelligence supply chains\" that harness analytics for business operations, via applications deployed ad-hoc and in command centers, to support customer engagement. Finally, I always enjoy hearing customer-experience expert Bruce Temkin , who keynoted at C3 for perhaps the third time. This year's talk was on \"people-centric experience design,\" which he characterizes as \"fostering an environment that creates positive, memorable human encounter.\" This design approach builds on purpose, empathy, and memories. While empathy in action, in corporate settings, boils down to ability to based decisions on deep customer insights -- that is, the product of analytics -- Bruce makes a key point that, in effect, it's personal, the ability of customer-experience designers to see products and services from the customers' point of view, as customers would experience them. The implication, of course, is that applications powered by the Clarabridge Intelligence Platform , coupled with Clarabridge Social Intelligence , will help corporations get there, to uniformly positive customer interactions, through intentional, designed customer experience. The addition of engagement capabilities to the Clarabridge product portfolio, as showcased at this year's C3 conference, is a significant advance toward that goal. Disclosure: Clarabridge waived my C3 registration fee, but I did not ask the company to pay my travel expenses. Clarabridge paid me for a contributed blog article, Sentiment Analysis and Business Sense .

The True Cost of Unused Software in Business [INFOGRAPHIC] Like it? 184 comment 1 Posted April 26, 2015 1E (a software lifecycle automation company) have conducted a recent study to show that businesses are spending excessive amounts of mony on software that is never being used! Just over 25% of software bought my companies remains dormant, what has resulted in the loss of around 3.5M in the UK alone.  “The cost of software audits can run into millions for large organisations, many do not realise they can make significant savings by reclaiming unused applications and gaining full visibility and control over their sprawling software estates.” Provided by 1E Login or register to post comments Authored by: Sophie Davidson Freelance writer Sophie Davidsonis passionate about providing engaging content and has featured in a number of online publications.  See complete profile Would you like to contribute to this site?

Experience vs. Data: Consuming Mark Zuckerberg as Data Like it? 266 comments 0 Posted June 4, 2011 Keywords : Decision Management , Data Visualization , Data Mining , Data Quality , Commentary One day last month, a dazzling sunny day in Paris , I faced a choice: Do I spend my last afternoon in a crowded tent listening to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, or do I dash across the river from the Tuileries and make a quick visit to the Musee d'Orsay (below)? I ended up bagging Zuckerberg. The decision boiled down to a question of experience vs. data. The walk across central Paris to the museum would be an experience. What I would learn from Mark Zuckerberg, for the most part, would be data, and I could just as easily consume it, either in writing or (far less likely) video whenever I wanted. I find that I make these data vs. experience decisions regularly. And some of them are changing. Baseball, for example. I usually consume it as a data stream, following pitches on my phone or computer as I talk to my wife (she doesn't like it), watch TV or barbecue a fish. The experience of conversation is often reduced to data, with text messages as the most basic. Of course, since my business involves selling pages and pages of data, I shouldn't put it down. But the information that comes in from our body, through experience, is the richest of our data channels--especially on a sunny day in Paris. I walked back from the museum up these steps from the Seine And saw this bird in the Tuilerie Gardens. I'm flying down to Madrid this morning and will be biking for the next week, from Leon to Santiago de Compostela, with an old friend.

The Statistics of Counter-Terrorism Like it? 151 comments 0 Posted September 12, 2011 Keywords : spending , terrorism , Statistics Is it worth more to save a person from a terrorist's bomb than, say, a car crash? John Mueller and Mark Stewart grapple with the spending choices we make in their new book about homeland security. The trouble, of course, is that much of what matters to us is unmeasurable. In the United States, we lose some 34,000 people a year in highway accidents. If we lost even a thousand a year--twenty per week--in terrorist attacts, the country would be likely be paralyzed by fear (and I can only imagine where that would take our politics.) Yet somehow we're able to pack the minivan, load the kids, jack up the radio, and head out onto deadly highways. Driving is a risk we're willing to accept. We feel safe even when we're not. And feeling safe, it can be argued, matters more within a society than numbers. Even if researchers made a convincing case that we could reduce deaths by 10,000 or 15,000 a year, I bet most people wouldn't support increased spending for it. That's because they (we) don't feel threatened--even if we should. Still, we spend lavishly on counterterrorism. And in the post 9/11 fervor, which was revisited on its 10th anniversary, much of the spending has gone unquestioned. That's going to change. I don't think we'll ever look at the numbers as coldly as Mueller and Stewart, who use the logic of a triage ward. I'm not convinced that we should. But their analysis provides a good starting point.

Top 5 Data Science Masters Programs Like it? 766 comments 0 Posted June 4, 2015 Keywords : Text Analytics , Commentary , Jobs Which top Masters Courses should you consider for a great career in data-science? A frequently cited study by McKinsey predicts that by 2018, the United States could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 \"people with deep analytic skills\" as well as 1.5 million \"managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions.\" The field is so hot right now that Roy Lowrance, the managing director of New York University's new Center for Data Science program says \"Anything that gets hot like this can only cool off.\" Regardless of this, the current school year won't be over for another five months and 50% to 75% of its students already have firm job offers! To say the least, data science involves some art because it requires creative experimentation. This balance of creative experimentation and detailed analysis is not attainable by everyone. Thus the demand-supply gap, as forecasted by multiple MNC’s, for the Data Scientist talent will never be completely filled! However, if you are comfortable with numbers and know how to code, even at the basic level, a career in Data Science is something you must explore. Here, we list down some of the best courses you can undertake to get the certification of being a Data Scientist:  1)    Harvard Data Science Course : This course, primarily, examines learning from data in order to gain useful predictions and insights. The people who take this course are expected to have prior programming experiences and a basic understanding of statistics. The main focus of this course is to teach students to deal with data (collect and prepare it), analyse the collected data and make useful predictions. The 5 focus areas of this course are: Data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set Data management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably Exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition Predictions based on statistical methods such as regression and classification Communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries  2)    UC Berkeley: Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) The UC Berkeley School of Information offers the only professional Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) delivered fully online. Through this program, you can achieve the Online Master’s Degree in Data Analytics [M. S.]. This can help you make sense of real-world phenomena and everyday activities by synthesizing and mining big data with the intention of uncovering patterns, relationships and trends. This course introduces students to concepts of information systems and the role of information systems within an organization. Topics covered will include: Organizational structure and behaviour Types of information systems, hardware and software issues Data collection tools and techniques, issues of complexity, and the relevance of information systems to larger social issues like sustainability 3)    Stanford University: Master of Science in Statistics: Data Science This program is a collaboration between Stanford’s Department of Statistics and Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. The core curriculum is, as you might imagine, heavy on mathematics and computer programming. This Data Science course is carved to attract, both, engineering or science students as well as mathematically oriented students. These students are interested in better understanding of the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of data science. They are looking to gain expertise in data science and its applications. 4)    Carnegie Mellon University: Master of Information Systems Management With the MISM program, the students will be trained in business process analysis and optimization, and will be educated on data warehousing, data mining, predictive modelling, GIS mapping, analytical reporting, segmentation analysis, and data visualization. This program has an important component of experiential learning. The students are trained to acquire the skills for analytic technology practices with applied business methods. Carnegie Mellon’s MISM focuses on three core areas: Business intelligence Data analytics Information technology 5)    North Carolina State University: Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) The Harvard Business Review recently identified this Institute among the best. It was identified as one of only a few sources of talent with proven strengths in data science alongside Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, and Carnegie Mellon. The curriculum is a carefully calibrated and a mix of applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, and business disciplines. The point to remember is that it always makes sense to get certified by trusted institutes and platforms when it comes to a niche job profile. Which course are you taking, Mr. Data Scientist?

Dynamic Cybersecurity Needs: Reassessing Security Like it? 388 comments 0 Posted November 30, 2014 Keywords : cybersecurity , Security , IT , Data Management As a recent report on Defending Data by Nuix found, cybersecurity needs are dynamic - 73 percent of surveyed participants report that their organization’s cybersecurity needs have changed in the past year. Another 69 percent expect their needs to change again within another year. When it comes to protecting their organizations from a data breach, 88 percent pinpoint human behavior as the primary weakness in any security plan. This comes as no surprise, as a number of breaches can be attributed to behaviors such as poor password management (using weak or default passwords, sharing or reusing them, etc.). Or, they may be tricked into sharing them with attackers, by means of a phishing email or fake login website. However, humans also built security technology solutions, and those can introduce a number of errors or vulnerabilities to an organization. And by implementing those security solutions, organizations may be lulled into a false sense of security and preparedness. Which may be avoided with some due diligence from the organization itself - Nuix reports that 27 percent of the survey’s respondents reassess their cybersecurity needs on a quarterly basis. Thirty-one percent conduct formal cybersecurity reassessments on a yearly basis. With new malware introduced month by month, and more information about new attacks with every breach investigation undergone, it’s important for organizations to realize cybersecurity is always changing. Identifying weak points on a regular basis can help keep your company ahead of the game. For example, if you’ve signed a number of new vendors and given them access to any applications that touch your network, you might want to ensure their access is secure in a few different ways: Limited privileges - Use role-based access controls to limit what their user accounts can do within your network or application(s), also known as employing granular permissions. Authentication - Require the use of not only a complex password, but also the use of two-factor authentication whenever vendors connect remotely. Standardize Tools - Choose a secure VPN or remote tool, and block the use of unsecured remote access tools used to connect to your systems. Log Activity - Set up logging in order to track user activity, including authentication attempts and any activity within your network to provide real-time and historical insight into anomalies. Additionally, 73 percent of respondents have since migrated data to the cloud, contributing to the idea that a perimeterless IT environment has emerged, creating new needs for security. In particular, the report identified legal teams and law firms as key targets, as they deal often with sensitive information.

Are You Making the Most of Your Dark Data? Like it? 221 comment 1 Posted March 19, 2014 Keywords : dark data , Big Data My favorite definition of ‘Dark Data’ comes from Matt Aslett of 451 Research: “Data that was previously ignored because of technology limitations.” I’ve recently talked to several big, traditional organizations that are finding lots of dark data down in the cellar. There’s obviously the unstructured* data that companies have gathered but struggled to analyze in the past. Technologies like Hadoop make it much easier to get useful data from sources such as legal documents, the comments sections of customer surveys, medical research studies, social data, web logs, and many others. But there’s also a lot of ‘dark’ structured data. It turns out that the number one use of Hadoop in most organizations today is analyzing  old data that was previously too costly to process. In addition to providing known value, this data provides an easy, low-risk pilot project for getting to know Hadoop. The structures are well-known, so getting the data out in a useable format doesn’t require complex data exploration or new scripting skills. Sometimes you may not realize that you have useful data. My favorite example of this is a project at Copenhagen Airport , where a team derived an amazing amount of useful information by crunching the data in the log files of the wifi routers scattered around the airport. Passengers smart phones “ping” the different routers as they walk through the terminals, even if they don’t actually connect to the network, and the team found they could track passenger movements and behavior to a reasonable level of precision. The data was used to determine facilities questions around typical passenger flows and choke points, but also to help answer more commercial questions such as “which is the most visited area of duty free?” The technology barriers have tumbled down, and it’s a good time to get out your bucket and flashlight and go take a look in your corporate cellar! * Hate that label?

Love the dark data definition as it is bang on the money.  Many organizations are not using their data dark and some have vital information about their operations without even knowing about it.  It is sad that most of the dark data is kept for compliance reasons but is not actually usable (even during an audit) because it is considered complicated from operations stand point and expensive from an IT standpoint. Who in the organization, in your view should be held responsible for converting the dark data into a gold data? We all know about the Big Data hype and the wealth of offering available, analyzing tools, ETL  (Hadoop), but this is very intimidating for the average business user.  How do we make this appealing for them? Is there a way that can consistently and productively convert all the dark data and make it usable again without expensive or extensive data migration projects?    Gadi  Share this comment: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Login or register to post comments Please note: Your first comment as a registered user will be held for moderation up to 24 hours (usually less).

Thoughts on the Future of Hadoop in Enterprise Environments Like it? 261 comments 0 Posted March 29, 2014 Keywords : enterprise social , Hadoop Between answering questions this week at  BI2014  in Orlando and preparing to ask some at  Hadoop Summit  in Amsterdam next week, here are some thoughts on where we are with Hadoop for the enterprise. The elephant in the room . It’s now clear that Hadoop will play a key part of your future enterprise architecture. But how will it integrate with existing infrastructures and other new technologies? Growing pains.  It’s teenagers vs parents. Teenagers are justifiably proud of disrupting the way their parents did things. But they have a tendency to underestimate the value of their parents' experience. As they get older, they’re forced to deal with more of the boring necessities of life — and realize their parents knew a thing or two after all. As Hadoop matures beyond pixel-only business models (social websites, online video games) and inexpensive data storage it is being forced to embrace — and learn a few lessons from — the enterprise systems that drive real-world business. Old dogs are learning new tricks.  Even without Hadoop, enterprise systems are poised for big disruptive changes. New in-memory systems eliminate the need for separate operational and analytic environments, combining transaction integrity with breakthrough performance. The data is stored once, and every transaction is available for analysis the instant it is written. The increased simplicity and agility of the system means it’s both faster and — despite the higher costs of memory — cheaper to run than traditional architectures. Simplicity and agility. Both Hadoop and in-memory deliver enterprise architects the agility that has been sorely missing in the past. Hadoop doesn’t require upfront definition of data schemas. In-memory systems offer fast analysis without complex caching and aggregate tables. Changes to support the business can be made in metadata, with less need to physically move data around. Updates can be made faster and more iterative. The future is uncertain—above all, you need an architecture than can change fluidly with new business opportunities. Not just new tech in old ways.  Information (not your transactional systems) is the new foundation of your future architecture. The data you are storing now you will still have in 20 years even through your applications will long since have changed. This means that it’s about more than using new technology in old ways, such as replacing part of enterprise data warehouses with more flexible Hadoop “data lakes” or adding faster in-memory data marts. It has to be about supporting the  business needs of the future Enterprises are looking for an “innovation platform” with real-time analysis tightly connected to operations in order to power more personalized customer experiences and flexible business models. Today’s complex choices.  Companies want to take advantage of the cost advantages of Hadoop systems, but they realize that Hadoop doesn’t yet do everything they need (for example, Gartner surveys show a steady decline in the proportion of CIOs that believe that NoSQL will replace existing data warehousing rather than augmenting it – now just 3%). And companies see the performance advantages of in-memory processing, but aren’t sure how it can make a difference to their business. The new technologies confound easy classification and the boundaries continue to blur. The elephant is starting to wear a tie, with projects to introduce transaction integrity to Hadoop. Enterprise systems are providing support for things like in-database MapReduce and text analysis . There’s no easy one-size-fits-all answer today. Different “innovation applications” require different tradeoffs, based on the types of data, the ratio of analysis to action, and the need for speed. Here are some examples of how Hadoop can fit in with enterprise architectures today . It’s not just about technology.  Organizations shouldn’t work on architecture without also thinking hard about how their business models may look in the future. And the success of Hadoop in the enterprise space depends as much on ecosystems of enterprise-savvy vendors and partners as it does on technology. The future seamless experience . Companies are looking for the “new best practice” of how to put together an end-to-end, enterprise-strength information architecture. Vendors are racing to support that architecture vision with a combination of new and tried-and-true technologies. The goal is to hide complexity by automating as much as possible the handoffs between the different data systems to provide a coherent system rather than companies having to duct tape everything together themselves. This will require enterprise vendors to embrace Hadoop as if it were their own technology — which may require culture changes for some. Vendors are also working on packaged “next generation” applications that combine operations, analytics, enterprise-ready mobile interfaces, links to third-party data, and integration with industry networks. Trust no one. The technology continues to evolve at a rapid rate. There has been lots of enterprise experimentation with Hadoop but few organizations have yet declared Hadoop a first-tier element of their enterprise architecture. In-memory processing systems are also in their infancy, just now making the transition from fast analytics to all-around business platforms. Best practice is being discovered as we speak — and may change fast in the light of new technology changes. Don’t trust anybody that claims that they can tell you the right way to do things unless they’ve first spent a lot of time understanding your business. Good luck, and join us in Amsterdam for more discussion!

SAP HANA Brings ROI of More Than 500% for the University of Kentucky Like it? 261 comments 0 Posted April 14, 2014 Keywords : Analytics , SAP HANNA SAP HANA is too often pigeonholed as expensive and only for extreme data needs. But more and more companies are crunching the numbers and realizing that in-memory processing is simply a cheaper, better way to do analytics . Dennis Howlett of Diginomica has already talked about the projected cost savings of $13M for one large government customer in his post Can SAP HANA bring real savings? Yes and the numbers are impressive . Now a new post on the SAP HANA blog has provided an IDC analysis of the University of Kentucky’s move to the HANA platform . HANA of course brought the expected technology benefits: Up to 420 times faster data reporting than legacy system Up to 15 times improvement in query load times Average data compression improvement of 77% Up to 87% reduction in extract, transform, and load (ETL) times Up to 80% of data updated in real time But what’s important is that this translates in direct business savings for the University compared to existing approaches: $6.17 million in benefits (discounted) over five years ROI of 509% Payback in 9.5 months And it’s not just about doing things more efficiently today, it’s about the new possibilities for the future: “The university believes that SAP HANA will help it realize other benefits, such as improved staff utilization rates, efficiencies in budgeting, and even revenue-producing mobile applications, although this study has not quantified these potential benefits because they are less near term in nature.” Download the study for more details!

Here’s a list of what I find are the most interesting trends in analytics in 2015. Why the italics? because most of what will happen this year can be summarized with a single word: more . Yes, there will be more data, more mobile analytics, more cloud analytics, more data discovery, more visualization, etc.—but these are the trends that I personally will be paying closer attention to over the year: More Magic Arthur C. Clark famously said that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” The analytics industry has recently seen big advances in technology, but it hasn’t yet turned into magic— tools and interfaces that “just work.” Today, people are required to shepherd every step of the analytics process, determining what data is available, how it should be joined, how it should stored, and how it should be analyzed and visualized. But the new power of advanced analytics and machine learning is now being applied to the process of analytics itself—so that more of the process can be automated. We should be able to point our tools at the data, and let the algorithms figure out it how it should be joined and cleansed, propose complementary data, and optimize how it should be stored (e.g. between cost-effective “cold” storage and operations-optimized “hot” storage). We should be able to let our tools identify outliers, find statistically-valid correlations, and propose the right types of visualization. Today, companies like SAP offer  Smart Data Access to connect data seamlessly between Hadoop/Spark and new in-memory analytics systems. And the  SAP Lumira  data discovery tool uses advanced statistics to automatically generate  Related Visualizations based on the data sets being viewed. 2015 will see more advanced automation based on these capabilities. Datafication Datafication is what happens when technology reveals previously invisible processes—which can then be tracked and optimized. This isn’t a new trend , but it’s gathering speed as real-time operational analytics systems become available and the price of gathering data continues to plummet. Connected devices are the highlight of this year’s CES conference . Beyond the dozens of fitness tracking devices already available, there are now  chips that stop you slouching , and sensor-enabled soccer balls ,  basketballs and  tennis rackets  to help you improve your game. Sensor tags can even help you find your keys . The key insight is that even simple data can lead to big insights. For example, sensor-equipped carpets promise to help seniors stay independent longer —not because the sensors themselves are complex, but because powerful pattern-detection algorithms can learn a resident’s normal gait and sound an alert if it starts to deteriorate. And who would have thought that fitness devices could locate the epicenter of an earthquake ?! And of course all this applies to commercial uses. Shoppers can be tracked with beacons , Inventory can be tracked via drones . You can spot process bottlenecks ,  optimize beer sales , and track real-time purchases . Here’s an instant business opportunity for 2015: find a process that is poorly tracked. Install simple sensors along the process and feed the collected real-time data to the cloud. Then use sophisticated analytics to feed actionable insights back to business people using mobile interfaces. For bonus points, add complementary third-party data sets, offer industry benchmarking, and encourage community best-practice sharing. Multipolar Analytics The layer-cake best-practice model of analytics (operational systems and external data feeding data marts and a data warehouse, with BI tools as the cherry on the top) is rapidly becoming obsolete. It’s being replaced by a new, multi-polar model where data is collected and analyzed in multiple places, according to the type of data and analysis required: New HTAP systems (traditional operational data and real-time analytics) Traditional data warehouses (finance, budgets, corporate KPIs, etc.) Hadoop/Spark (sensor and polystructured data, long-term storage and analysis) Standalone BI systems (personal and departmental analytics, including spreadsheets) There are clear overlaps with each of these systems, and they will converge over time, but each is a powerful hub that is not going to be replaced by the others any time soon. In 2015 we will see the development of more best-practice guidance for how to get the most out of this pragmatic—but complex—collection of analysis hubs. This will involve both regular data feeds between poles and federated analysis to provide a connected view across the enterprise (including, hopefully, some more “magic”—see point 1). Questions that enterprise architects will have to answer for different uses include: Where will this data arrive first ? Will it need to be move to another pole as part of an analysis? When and why? Where and when will the data be modeled, and by whom? What are the different levels of access that will be given to different users, with what governance? Fluid Analysis Analytic infrastructures have been too brittle. With the right setup, they have provided powerful, flexible analytics—but implementing systems takes too long and it has been a challenge to keep up with the changing needs of the organization. The latest analytics technologies allow for fluid analytics that adapt more gracefully to changing needs, with better support for one-off analysis and the analytics lifecycle: Rather than having to define a schema/business model upfront, Hadoop allows schema on read  queries that combine the data as and when necessary. With the right skills, business users (or more likely data scientists) can ask any question that can be answered by the available data, making unplanned or one-off analyses faster and more cost-effective. In-memory HTAP systems allow powerful analysis directly on detailed operational data, and the analytics schema is defined in metadata. This means it can be updated without having to physically create new tables. For example, an in-memory finance system allows you to quickly and easily view the consequences of a new regional structure on your accounts—without having to move any data. Governed data discovery systems make it easier to manage the typical lifecycle of new types of analysis, for example by allowing successful personal or departmental analytics to be identified and industrialized for enterprise-wide use. Community Analytics is no longer under the control of well-meaning central IT dictatorships . As decisions about IT spending increasingly move to business units, analytics projects have to have the consent of the governed —and this means big changes to every aspect of analytics organization. 2015 will see the further development of the  community governance of analytics . Analytics leads will have to develop the skills they need to build and nurture internal social networks that will set priorities and put pressure on maverick BI projects. To do this, they have to behave more like politicians, paying closer attention to the needs of their electorate and cajoling everybody to play their part for the good of the community as a whole. Analytic Ecosystems In a logical extension of datafication within an organization, 2015 will see more analytics across business networks, helping optimize processes between the participants of an ecosystem. Some examples include: The Smart Port Logistics platform created by the Hamburg Port Authority . It is designed to connect all of the participants of the port, including the shipping companies, trucking companies, customs officials, and even the truck car parks and retail outlets. By collecting, analyzing, and feeding back information in real time, the Port Authority helps all the participants become more efficient. The cooperation of Volkswagen, Shell, and SAP on a  connected car ecosystem. The largest business network, Ariba , is offering sophisticated predictive analytics to give insights across connected processes including early warnings of potential supply chain disruption. Data Privacy Data privacy laws and processes are now lag far behind the power of available technology. Serious abuses have already come to light  and there are probably many others that haven’t yet been revealed. 2015 will see some welcome advances in the default use of encryption , but more sweeping changes are required to control how people combine and access personal data sets. Ultimately this is a problem than can only be fixed by society, laws, and cultural changes—and unfortunately, those changes will probably only come about after much pain and suffering. An equivalent analogy might be the use of  asbestos in construction. Because it had many useful qualities, including affordability, sound absorption, and resistance to fire, it was widely used around the world, despite concerns over toxicity .  The asbestos industry and governments played down the dangers until the deadly consequences could no longer be denied. Government intervention came only after many people had suffered—and the US still  lags behind other developed countries that have banned its use. The new controls mean that changes to existing buildings can be very expensive. As you’re building your big data solutions, make sure you do it with proper data controls in place, and don’t abuse people’s expectations of how their data will be used, whether or not you have a legal right to do so today. Making the right choices today will help you avoid social risk and/or expensive changes in the future. Conclusion In their recent book, the Second Machine Age , authors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that we are now in the “ second half of the chessboard ” when it comes to computer technology. The exponential trend means the increases in data processing power this year will be the equivalent of decades of progress in the past. Nowhere is this clearer than in the area of analytics, where the biggest problem is increasingly that organizations just don’t know which of the myriad business opportunities to implement first. 2015 will be a wonderful year for analytics, just like it has been for the last quarter-century—as long as we remember that great power brings great responsibility, and that we must also strive to adapt our information culture and processes.

Top BI Events in 2010, Top BI Trends in 2011 Like it? 321 comments 2 Posted November 30, 2010 Keywords : events , Business Intelligence Ajay Ohri of DecisionStats.com has posted my email interview on Business Intelligence trends – you can read a copy below. What do you think I missed? Ajay: “What are the top 5 events in Business Integration and Data Visualization services you saw in 2010 and what are the top three trends you see in these in 2011.”   Top five events in 2010: (1) Back to strong market growth. IT spending plummeted last year (business intelligence continued to grow, but more slowly than previous years). This year, organizations reopened their wallets and funded new analytics initiatives — all the signs indicate that BI market growth will be double that of 2009. (2) The launch of the iPad. Mobile BI has been around for years, but the iPad opened the floodgates of organizations taking a serious look at mobile analytics — and the easy-to-use, executive-friendly iPad dashboards have considerably raised the profile of analytics projects inside organizations. (3) Data warehousing got exciting again. Decades of incremental improvements (column databases, massively parallel processing, appliances, in-memory processing…) all came together with robust commercial offers that challenged existing data storage and calculation methods. And new “NoSQL” approaches, designed for the new problems of massive amounts of less-structured web data, started moving into the mainstream. (4) The end of Google Wave, the start of social BI. Google Wave was launched as a rethink of how we could bring together email, instant messaging, and social networks. While Google decided to close down the technology this year, it has left its mark, notably by influencing the future of “social BI”, with several major vendors bringing out commercial products this year. (5) The start of the big BI merge. While several small independent BI vendors reported strong growth, the major trend of the year was consolidation and integration: the BI megavendors (SAP, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft) increased their market share (sometimes by acquiring smaller vendors, e.g. IBM/SPSS and SAP/Sybase) and integrated analytics with their existing products, blurring the line between BI and other technology areas. Top three trends next year: (1) Analytics, reinvented. New DW techniques make it possible to do sub-second, interactive analytics directly against row-level operational data. Now BI processes and interfaces need to be rethought and redesigned to make best use of this — notably by blurring the distinctions between the “design” and “consumption” phases of BI. (2) Corporate and personal BI come together. The ability to mix corporate and personal data for quick, pragmatic analysis is a common business need. The typical solution to the problem — extracting and combining the data into a local data store (either Excel or a departmental data mart) — pleases users, but introduces duplication and extra costs and makes a mockery of information governance. 2011 will see the rise of systems that let individuals and departments load their data into personal spaces in the corporate environment, allowing pragmatic analytic flexibility without compromising security and governance. (3) The next generation of business applications . Where are the business applications designed to support what people really do all day, such as implementing this year’s strategy, launching new products, or acquiring another company? 2011 will see the first prototypes of people-focused, flexible, information-centric, and collaborative applications, bringing together the best of business intelligence, “enterprise 2.0”, and existing operational applications. And one that should happen, but probably won’t: (4) Intelligence = Information + PEOPLE . Successful analytics isn’t about technology — it’s about people, process, and culture. The biggest trend in 2011 should be organizations spending the majority of their efforts on user adoption rather than technical implementation.

When we talk to teams of BI-oriented people at our client sites, there's still a strong tendency for clients to talk to us about the \"Analytics, Reinvented\" discussion stuff you mention above: It's all about what technology we can give them to do slice-and-dice analytics. They rarely focus on non-technical and non-analytical people. I think that we (the media, consultants, and vendors) need to educate people about the need to deploy specially tailored, easily digestible BI to people who don't even know what \"BI\" is -- including people outside their firewall, too.

Collaborative BI – Share Your Insights Like it? 196 comment 1 Posted December 6, 2011 Keywords : Social Data , Business Intelligence , Collaborative Data 'Social networking' and 'Collaboration' have become a part of our lives in this connected world. Let us see how the two can work together in helping us make better decisions. ‘Social networking’ has been a growing phenomenon in the past 2-3 years. The society that we live in has almost suddenly become very ‘social’ and all issues of privacy have almost disappeared. People want to share information about their private life (family, jobs, hobbies, etc.) and have more ‘friends’ and ‘followers’ than ever before. With the advent of mobile computing, the urge to share anything, anywhere and anytime has taken off beyond limits. ‘Collaboration’ on the other hand, has been in existence for a long time with people wanting to share their documents and content using tools like document repositories, email, web/video/voice conferencing, online groups, etc. People participate in forums and groups, share ideas, contribute and work towards achieving common goals.  Collaboration has been pervasive in areas of document sharing (like sharepoint) and video conferencing (like webex) but hasn’t really taken off in the area of our current interest…BI. Collaboration in BI is currently mostly limited to sharing reports on a web portal or through emails. How many of you have seen reports that are developed in a ‘collaborative’ environment or shared with multiple consumers for collaborative decision-making? This new age can see ‘Social networking’ and ‘collaboration’ come together and provide a platform that is more powerful than ever.  Enterprises want to make use of this powerful platform to not only develop and share the reports through collaboration, but also seek advice, set departmental and corporate priorities, influence outcomes and ensure that every decision made has consensus and approval at the same time.  Collaborative BI software like Arcplan Engage and Lyzasoft are taking a lead in this area of unmet needs. Most of us already use social networking platforms and get that concept very well. We know how to share our ideas and how to ‘like’, ‘follow’ and ‘rate’. The idea of instant validation of ideas through your network helps in refining your ideas even further.  The same concept is applied to BI. Reports are developed by users, shared with colleagues/managers on a this collaborative platform, advice/feedback sought using the social networking features, changes/suggestions incorporated, analysis and decisions made through consensus….could life of an analyst be any better? Add ‘context awareness’ to the mix and you will find data/reports that are relevant to what you are looking for with probably no need for re-writing queries/reports. Though this concept has been around for a couple of years, it hasn’t really caught on with majority of enterprises. Reasons could vary from the traditional mindset of ownership of data/reports to sense of independent decision-making.  It will be a while before the BI user comes of age. Mobile computing and social networking are making ‘Collaborative BI’ more exciting and I hope this new platform will drive efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making.

How IoT Applications Can Help Businesses Grow Internally Like it? 413 comments 2 Posted January 7, 2016 Keywords : Analytics , internet of things , IoT , Big Data , IT The Internet of Things (IOT) can be referred as networks of physical objects that are embedded with electronics, sensors, software and network interconnectivity that enables data collection and exchange. IOT creates integrations between computer-based systems and physical world, by allowing the objects to be sensed and controlled through existing network infrastructure. The technology encompasses smart homes, smart grids, smart cities, and intelligent transportation. Many companies are still in the early stage of IOT adoption. However, by looking at already working IOT strategies, business managers might reconsider adopting the application to grow their business internally. How IoT applications can help businesses A company may choose to employ on web tracking of customer's behaviors. On web navigations, patterns concerning the type of clients, the devices they are using, and other relevant data can be aggregated to form a complete picture. This can enrich forecast and marketing analysis. IOT application can also be used to identify dangerous websites. They allow system administrators to track machines internet site visited by organization computers, and they can uncover harmful sites. This cut-down exposure to risky to virus and malware introduction. In addition, IOT applications can be applied to facilitate monitoring. This includes devices such as temperature thermostat that can be deployed remotely as part of facility maintenance and energy conservation. Moreover, devices with a sensor that communicate with a computer system can be placed on infrastructure materials and machines such as bridges and railroads, to monitor the health of various components and issue out alerts whenever components are compromised. The technology can enable proactive maintenance before failure is recorded. Business items and the asset can be tracked from the start to the end using IOT application central system. Transportation industry deploys sensors to moving trucks and components that are being transported. This enabled organization supply chain to stay on track, and eliminates theft of goods in remote areas since management has full visibility of where shipments are at any particular time. Besides, shipping containers holding perishable goods can be controlled by sensors that issues alerts whenever humidity or temperature exceed a particular level. Also, whenever seal or containers are tampered, sensors issues alert to the real-time centralized system thus enabling the situation to be remedied. Many commercial vendors employ GPS data aggregates and IOT application to drive meaningful information. It allows them to pull demographic data, pictorial data, infrastructure data and other types of data that can be pinned to geographic locations. How IT professionals need to set network monitoring solutions High-performance network forms a fundamental requirement for IOT functioning infrastructure in any organization. To ensure smooth business running, all system need to run without failure including internal and external communication with IOT applications, this call for practical IOT network monitoring solutions. There are many free options for network monitoring solutions available , including open source software. Several factors, besides the cost, should be considered in decision making. This includes a given infrastructures and characteristic of a potential solution. The most networks problem arise from something changing, thus, the best network monitoring solutions do not only alert users about changes but help to troubleshoot the problem by comparing network state and how it was before changes occurred. Most proactive network monitoring solutions issue alerts via text or email—these enable the user to address the issue as quickly as possible. IOT applications use different networks. However, there are four fundamental areas that every network monitoring solution should be able to address : it should monitor PC hardware and others supplies, this includes issuing alerts whenever there is a change in a network device, whenever device loses connectivity, or whenever disks are removed or added. It should be able to monitor software regarding installed and uninstalled programs. Monitor web traffic considering that various networks use various bandwidths and can switch and accidentally override other networks. In addition, it should be able to keep track of IT services information such software and contract expiration date. All and all, businesses should pursue IoT applications to help their business grow from within as well as impact their respective industry and consumer base.

That is, to maximize their performance in using information, organizations have to collect and analyze ever increasing volumes of data while the tools available are constantly evolving in the big data ecosystem that I have written about . In our benchmark research on big data analytics , half (51%) of organizations said they want to access big data using their existing BI tools. At the same time, as I have noted , end users are demanding self-service access to data preparation capabilities  to facilitate their analyses.

In essence, PRO enables companies to surf the demand curve using dynamic rather than fixed pricing to achieve the most desirable trade-offs between revenue volume and profit margins. The trade-off is defined by strategic factors such as the company’s market position, product and service portfolio, and marketing strategy.

Telecommunications was mainly in the hands of national and regional telecom companies, which essentially owned all the cables in the ground. The call center market was dominated by a small number of vendors that provided on-premises systems to manage and route calls when they arrived at a company’s offices. The telecom model was in effect the first cloud-based service, though almost no one stopped to think about how a call made on one device arrived at another. The arrival of the internet and wireless technologies and the telecom companies’ willingness to lease capacity on their lines changed both models. Now almost any company can provide communication services, and the majority of contact center systems are cloud-based. In this evolution some organizations that previously were hidden behind the telecoms have emerged as suppliers of communications and contact center services.

These sources include websites, applications, unstructured documents, data stores and desktop spreadsheets. RPA software does repetitive, low-value work that otherwise may be performed by person. It saves time in these tasks, completing them sooner and freeing skilled individuals to concentrate on work that utilizes their skills to the fullest. One of the earliest uses of software robots was “Web crawling,” which automated rapid collection of data posted on websites, for example, prices and locations. This was the Kofax Kapow’s original purpose, but its scope has expanded. When used to gather information from multiple applications, the software precludes the need for setting up and maintaining a separate data store. This saves time and money while ensuring that the information has come from the authoritative source and that there is no latency in the data. Rather than taking the time to write a program with broad applicability, a robot can be quickly configured to perform a specific task in a way that mimics how an individual does the job.

As a consequence, contact centers are likely to remain a key channel to handle customer interactions, and it is likely that contact center agents will have to handle multiple forms of interactions, which are likely to be more complex. The research also shows that interactions are increasingly being handed by all business groups, not just the contact center. To meet these demanding customer expectations, organizations must continue to carefully manage the availability of skilled resources to handle these interactions.

The core capabilities of a CRM system were to manage customer data, marketing campaigns, sales opportunities and service requests. Vendors also touted them as the source for a comprehensive “360 degree” view of the customer, which they could never actually deliver because they did not include customer financial data, interaction histories or customer sentiment in the form of feedback. In any case CRM applications became integral to contact centers as a source of information to answer customer queries, but in reality they did little to actually manage the customer relationship, which was a factor in why they gained a bad reputation. Over time, many vendors adopted a different approach and broke the CRM category into marketing, sales and service clouds, which although they include additional capabilities basically do the same thing, with one big drawback – customer data is managed in three different systems, reducing the availability of a single source of customer data even further.

Consider how poorly your organization would perform if it had to operate using 25-year-old software and hardware. Having the latest technology isn’t always necessary, but it’s important for executives to understand that technology shapes a finance organization’s ability to improve its overall effectiveness.

Nearly all organizations have some need to access big data sources and produce actionable information for decision-makers. Recognizing this connection, we merged these two topics when we put together our recently published research agendas for 2017 . As we plan our research, we focus on current technologies and how they can be used to improve an organization’s performance. We then share those results with our readers.

Our benchmark research into the next-generation contact center in the cloud  shows that for 70 percent of companies, customer experience is and will be an important way of competing; the largest growth in ways of competing is to introduce digital self-service, which will increase by 12 percent. To support those changes, organizations have introduced more channels of engagement, to the extent that our research shows the average has grown to eight channels. Our benchmark research into next-generation customer engagement  shows that in nearly half (47%) of organizations these channels are managed as silos, which indicates that most organizations still operate multiple channels rather than supporting omnichannel engagement. The next-generation contact center research confirms that customer engagement is an enterprise-wide issue but one-third (33%) of companies struggle to provide consistent responses across touch points.

As we put together these plans we think about the forces that are shaping the markets that we cover and then craft agendas that study these issues to provide insights for our community. I’ve been working in the business intelligence (BI) and analytics market for nearly 25 years, and throughout that time the industry has been trying to make analytics useful to increasingly wider audiences. That focus continues to today. Better search and presentation methods, including visual discovery and natural-language processing, are promising ways to engage more users. We also see organizations supporting their users in specific functional roles with relevant and accessible analytics. My colleagues examine these issues as part of their agendas in the Office of Finance ,  Sales ,  Marketing ,  Customer Experience ,  Operations and Supply Chain , and Human Capital Management . While their agendas include analytics within specific domains, my own research focuses on a range of analytics issues across domains including cloud computing, mobility, collaboration, data science and the Internet of Things.

Our Office of Finance benchmark research  reveals that most organizations use spreadsheets to manage their tax provision and analysis: Half (52%) rely solely on spreadsheets, and another 38 percent mainly use them. I recommend to corporations that operate in multiple countries and that have even a moderately complex legal entity structure that they consider establishing what I call a tax data warehouse of record.

This advance enables virtually any device to transmit its data, to which analytics can then be applied to facilitate monitoring and a range of operational functions. IoT can deliver value in several ways. It can provide organizations with more complete data about their operations, which helps them improve efficiencies and so reduce costs. It also can deliver a competitive advantage by enabling them to reduce the elapsed time between an event occurring and operational responses, actions taken or decisions made in response to it. IoT utilizes what Ventana Research calls operational intelligence, a discipline that has evolved from the capture and analysis of data from instrumentation and machine-to-machine interactions of many types. We define operational intelligence as a set of event-centered information and analysis processes operating across an organization that deliver information to enable effective actions and optimal decisions. The evolution of operational intelligence and its manifestation in IoT is encouraging companies to revisit their priorities and spending for information and other digital technologies. Ventana Research undertook benchmark research on The Internet of Things  to determine the attitudes, requirements and future plans of organizations that use IoT and operational intelligence systems and to identify their best practices. We set out to examine both the commonalities and the qualities specific to major industry sectors and across sizes of organizations. We considered how organizations manage IoT, issues they encounter in the process and how their use of it and related technology is evolving. While the Internet of Things may still be a novelty to many consumers, organizations participating in our research are well aware of its applications and implications. Four out of five (81%) said IoT is important to their future operations. Majorities said the use of IoT is very important to speed the flow of information and improve the responsiveness of individuals within business processes (61%) and to speed the flow of information to customers or consumers (58%). The most common uses of IoT are associated with customers (as in sensors on products, by 43%), employees (in wearable technology, 35%) and sensors on devices in the supply chain (31%). At this point, however, more organizations are able to capture IT events (such as a network or system security breach, 59%) than business events (such as a customer contact, 45%). As organizations find more business uses, IoT and operational intelligence will become even more mainstream, and the research indicates that this will occur. Within two years, 95 percent of organizations said they expect to be capturing IT events and 92 percent to be capturing business events. The research also finds that the intentions of organizations to embrace IoT and use operational intelligence often outpace their current capabilities. For example, many can capture data but face challenges in using it. More than two-thirds (68%) said they are satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their organization’s ability to capture and correlate data from events. After that, managing and using it become more complicated. Nearly one-third (31% each) reported difficulties with inadequate data or in managing external data. About half (48%) said they spend the most time reviewing event data for quality and consistency issues, which suggests a lack of standardization across the data sources that are collected. Furthermore, most organizations are not ready to derive maximum value from IoT. The processes most commonly implemented, each by approximately half of organizations, are performing root-cause analysis, defining measurements and metrics, and monitoring and correlating activities or events. While these processes are necessary, they are only the first step in improving performance. Fewer have advanced to the point of automating processes, which will be necessary to make full use of the coming deluge of IoT data. For example, only about two in five use data from events to trigger automated processes such as predictive maintenance (38%) or automatic assignment of thresholds for alerts (39%). This research overall finds strong momentum behind the emergence of the Internet of Things, but it also is clear that many organizations have not caught up to the trend. IoT is here, and its impact on business will only increase; almost all companies can benefit from paying attention to it. We encourage you to use this research to help educate and guide your organization through its IoT journey.

While their agendas include analytics within specific domains, my own research focuses on a range of analytics issues across domains including cloud computing, mobility, collaboration, data science and the Internet of Things. Adoption of analytics in the cloud, as evidenced in our Data and Analytics in the Cloud research continues, promising both to shorten the analytic time to value and to provide universal accessibility in a variety of devices and locations. Organizations also continue to expand cloud usage and acceptance for a wider variety of workloads. With the existence of more data sources in the cloud, we see a new information highway emerging based on cloud-enabled analytics and integration capabilities. The research finds nearly half (47%) of organizations moving data from cloud systems to on-premises and more than one-quarter (29%) moving data between cloud-based systems. Another recent example, from our Internet of Things Benchmark Research , shows nearly two in five (39%) organizations [IoT Q39] processing messages or events in the cloud as part of their IoT and operational intelligence implementations. Users have come to expect and organizations are providing expanded access to analytics and BI via mobile devices. We recently examined vendor offerings in the Mobile Analytics and Business Intelligence Value Index for 2016 . Simplification of the design of user interfaces that work on mobile devices in a variety of formats will continue to improve access to analytics. Cloud deployments coupled with HTML5 are key elements of a mobile strategy. We’ll monitor the use mobile technology for easy and continuous access to and distribution of analytics. Mobile technology also enables constant communication and collaboration. Social media has conditioned the market to expect and embrace collaboration. Forward-looking organizations are deploying collaboration technologies to put analytics into action, supporting both dialogues and workflow around decision-making. We’ll be checking market trends to monitor the state of collaboration for analytics across business and IT. Making analytics more accessible is particularly challenging when it comes to data science. Data science includes a variety of advanced analytic techniques including predictive, descriptive and prescriptive analytics as well machine learning. These techniques are critical to understanding the potential of big data, and as big data continues to rise, the importance of data science rises as well. However, most organizations are constrained by limited people resources who have the skills necessary to create these analyses. One trend we are watching is the emergence of machine learning to optimize actions, decisions and processes and require fewer highly skilled resources. Machine learning can also be a way to exploit big data for business optimization; we’ll be conducting benchmark research on how organizations are using big data in their business processes. The Internet of Things is another key area of big data analytics, and as noted above, we recently published benchmark research on it. An increasing number of devices are instrumented and connected to generate massive amounts of data on an ongoing basis. We’ll continue to share insights from this groundbreaking research in the coming months. We’ll also explore how big data and streaming technologies intersect with data science to enable continuous analytics on the IoT stream of information. We’ll be studying these issues and more throughout the year. Please download and review  our full Analytics research agenda .  I invite you to participate in this research as we conduct it during the year. I look forward to sharing the insights we discover and to helping your organization apply those insights to its business needs.

As we plan our research, we focus on current technologies and how they can be used to improve an organization’s performance. We then share those results with our readers. Our research agenda for big data and information management begins with data preparation. We recently launched a benchmark research study on the topic and invite you to participate in it . End users today expect to be able to access data sources directly without support from IT. Data preparation attempts to solve that problem by making data more accessible throughout the information life cycle, in the end adding value to business and IT processes. In our research, we’ll explore how organizations establish data preparation to provide information responsiveness while also supporting enterprise requirements for data quality, governance and security. The larger context of data preparation is the overall process of data integration. Data sources are larger, more diverse and more distributed, found in cloud-based systems, unstructured data and connected devices generating data throughout the enterprise. Data lakes and data virtualization are two ways in which organizations can integrate and provide access to these diverse data sources. We’ll look how organizations utilize data lakes, including whether they are using data virtualization, for comprehensive data sets that support both analytics and data governance. In a related area, organizations face challenges when new data types and sources have been adopted without sufficient data governance. The open source ecosystem surrounding big data, which I have written about , necessitates the creation of new governance capabilities, which has spawned new open source projects and has attracted independent software vendors (ISVs) to fill in gaps with new governance tools. Our research will identify best practices for developing and implementing a comprehensive data governance strategy for all types of data, both new and old. The Internet of Things, which includes an increasing number of devices that are instrumented and connected, drives a new set of requirements in addition to governance. IoT data is generated constantly, increasing demands for streaming data technologies combined with data science to enable continuous analytics. Our recent IoT benchmark researc h shows that nearly half (46%) of organizations [IoT Q25] consider it essential to process IoT events in seconds or subseconds. We have further research planned to complement our IoT research by studying how organizations are dealing with streams of machine data and IoT data. We’ll also be diving deeper into the IoT research we have completed to share more of our findings and their implications for organizations of all sorts. As organizations increase their arrays of big data sources, including streams of IoT data, the importance of data science also increases. Traditional analytical tools and techniques are not effective at identifying all the valuable relationships in large bodies of data, nor are people effective at real-time processing. Data science helps tackle these issues. However, as our Next-Generation Predictive Analytics research  shows, most organizations suffer from a lack of skilled data science resources. More than three-quarters (79%) of participants reported that users don’t have enough skills to perform their own data science analyses. Machine learning provides a potential solution to this skills shortage, at least in part. Through self-learning algorithms, the development and refinement of data science routines become more automated, requiring fewer resources to develop models that predict and optimize outcomes. Such automation is critical in the areas of big data and IoT. Manual processes simply cannot support the volumes of data and the continuous analysis required. We’ll take a close look at how machine learning impacts organizations as part of our 2017 agenda. At the core of all these issues, information management requirements continue to grow. Both IT and lines of business need to be able to manage large volumes of structured and unstructured data, often streaming on a continuous basis. Big data technologies continue to proliferate to support streaming, at-rest and in-memory data. We will be studying how organizations deal with this proliferation of technologies to extract business value from the data that they gather. For the full list of research planned, please download and review  our Big Data and Information Management research agenda . I invite you to participate in this research as we conduct it during the year. I look forward to sharing the insights we discover and to helping your organization apply those insights to its business needs.

This advance enables virtually any device to transmit its data, to which analytics can then be applied to facilitate monitoring and a range of operational functions. IoT can deliver value in several ways. It can provide organizations with more complete data about their operations, which helps them improve efficiencies and so reduce costs. It also can deliver a competitive advantage by enabling them to reduce the elapsed time between an event occurring and operational responses, actions taken or decisions made in response to it.

Nearly five years ago I wrote about the three V’s  as a way to explain why new and different technologies were needed to deal with big data. Since then the industry has tackled many of the technical challenges associated with the three V’s. In 2017 I propose that we focus instead on a different letter, which includes these A’s: analytics, awareness, anticipation and action. I’ll explain why each is important at this stage of big data evolution.

Nearly all organizations have some need to access big data sources and produce actionable information for decision-makers. Recognizing this connection, we merged these two topics when we put together our recently published research agendas for 2017 . As we plan our research, we focus on current technologies and how they can be used to improve an organization’s performance. We then share those results with our readers.

As we put together these plans we think about the forces that are shaping the markets that we cover and then craft agendas that study these issues to provide insights for our community. I’ve been working in the business intelligence (BI) and analytics market for nearly 25 years, and throughout that time the industry has been trying to make analytics useful to increasingly wider audiences. That focus continues to today. Better search and presentation methods, including visual discovery and natural-language processing, are promising ways to engage more users. We also see organizations supporting their users in specific functional roles with relevant and accessible analytics. My colleagues examine these issues as part of their agendas in the Office of Finance ,  Sales ,  Marketing ,  Customer Experience ,  Operations and Supply Chain , and Human Capital Management . While their agendas include analytics within specific domains, my own research focuses on a range of analytics issues across domains including cloud computing, mobility, collaboration, data science and the Internet of Things.

That is, to maximize their performance in using information, organizations have to collect and analyze ever increasing volumes of data while the tools available are constantly evolving in the big data ecosystem that I have written about . In our benchmark research on big data analytics , half (51%) of organizations said they want to access big data using their existing BI tools. At the same time, as I have noted , end users are demanding self-service access to data preparation capabilities  to facilitate their analyses.

Analyst bio Understanding Gamification in APAC Posted by John Brand on July 23, 2013 1 comment 199 Recommendations Tweet Share on Facebook Forrester's global analysts have written some great pieces on gamification . In general terms, this research is is just as applicable to the SE Asian markets. However, there are some specific differences within the region that should also be considered. The most important thing to remember is that, while the general principles of gamification definitely hold true within the region, there are still some specific differences that should also be taken into account.   First and foremost, we definitely see the same problems in APAC where a lack of clarity on the desired behaviour encourages game play - for games sake. This is probably the worst outcome of all for gamification initiatives, regardless of where they're deployed. If there's no clear desired behaviour change identified, there's absolutely no valid reason to introduce gamification. The real challenge though is ensuring that the right strategy is selected to achieve the right objectives.   Read more Categories: APAC Asia Social Media Users User Experience customer engagement digital engagement gamification systems of engagement SAS attempts to bridge the traditional analytics and big data/cloud divide Posted by John Brand on July 19, 2013 359 Recommendations Tweet Share on Facebook A number of my colleagues and I attended the recent global SAS analyst event to understand the future of SAS’s business and technology strategy. It was clear to me from this event that SAS is attempting to bridge the increasing divide between “traditional” analytics and the big data and cloud-based analytics worlds. Here’s a few of our key observations and takeaways from the event: A greater emphasis on visual analytics. The range of tools available and the integration capabilities to enable visual analytics will be significantly improved in future releases. Better support for governance and audit. One of the benefits that any decision support system should provide is better business governance – the transparency and auditability of how and why decisions were made and what data was used to make them. SAS continues to make good progress here. A more encompassing view of big data. Most analytic vendors believe either nothing – or everything - has changed in the emerging world of big data. SAS’s view is generally an inclusive one, which will be more beneficial to clients long-term if successfully implemented. The SAS architecture is evolving towards supporting big data economies of scale, in theory at least. Better integration with all forms of cloud technologies. Still operating largely at the OS virtualisation layer, SAS is nonetheless extending its portfolio to include a range of cloud-enabled architectures. We expect that client demand will drive further development here.

The first was in a restaurant where the wait staff used their own smartphones and a simple order taking app. There was no expensive mobile platform for the restaurant to purchase in order to use this system. There was no expensive training program in place to teach the employees how to use the software. They simply bring along their own phone, download a free app to their device and start working. The software is intuitive enough that any training required is done by their fellow staff members during shifts. What’s interesting about this example is that using mobile devices for taking restaurant orders isn’t new – but using employees own devices is. Previously, the expense incurred by restaurants having to purchase proprietary devices meant that only high margin operations could afford to use mobile order taking systems. And loss, theft or damage of the devices was not only expensive but also proved to be a sticking point for employer/employee relations.    The second example provides a sharp contrast. It involved a trip to a museum and the use of the audio commentary service. Though almost every visitor to the museum now has a smart phone device, an old proprietary hand held device was still in use there. This is an expensive option to operate for a low-margin business like a museum. There are now museums that have recognised this and offer apps on smart phones with capabilities well beyond what the previous dedicated hardware could provide. One such museum is the American Museum of Natural History. It not only uses the rich visual interface of the smart phone, along with the required basic audio commentary services, but it also reportedly helps the user navigate the complex campus using sophisticated wi-fi triangulation.

But in all cases, it turned out that the challenge wasn’t really providing multilingual support. Instead, organizations are struggling to meet demand among customers, suppliers, partners, regulators and others for direct access to core enterprise systems from multiple regions, often through mobile devices or pervasive web applications. So the real question is: How are user engagement strategies affecting our ability to achieve a single, global business and technology platform that supports the increasingly pervasive use of mobile technologies? This is now a top-of-mind consideration for many companies, especially as emerging markets are an increasingly important part of their global business strategies. The challenge is how best to tailor and adapt their products and services to capitalize on these emerging market opportunities without losing the benefits of economies of scale and the requirements for global transparency and compliance. And it’s not just about global IT service delivery; it’s about how technology can now serve the unique needs of both internal and external users, particularly where major differences may exist across language, culture, law, infrastructure, geography, value systems, and the economy.

Australia has always been an early adopter of new technologies but I’d also like to think that we’re a little smarter and savvier than your average geek back in high school in 1982. IBM’s Watson announcement is significant, not necessarily because of the sophistication of the Watson technology, but because of IBM's ability to successfully market the Watson concept.    To take us all back a little, the term ‘cognitive computing’ emerged in response to the failings of what was once termed ‘artificial intelligence’. Though the underlying concepts have been around for 50 years or more, AI remains a niche and specialist market with limited applications and a significant trail of failed or aborted projects. That’s not to say that we haven’t seen some sophisticated algorithmic based systems evolve. There’s already a good portfolio of large scale, deep analytic systems developed in the areas of fraud, risk, forensics, medicine, physics and more.

Posted by John Brand on January 8, 2013 448 Recommendations Tweet Share on Facebook A number of Forrester analysts from the Asia Pacific region attended the recent SAP analyst event in Singapore. Meetings with SAP global and regional executives and a large number of detailed breakout sessions over the 1½-day event all clearly indicate that SAP is continuing to try and reposition itself as a true generalized application platform player. At the core of (almost all) initiatives is the HANA in-memory database technology. Whatever the problem, HANA will solve it (said with tongue planted very firmly in cheek). While the technology clearly has immediate performance benefits, particularly for existing SAP clients, net-new customers will likely need to compare the value of SAP’s offerings with others much more seriously.

The mere fact that vendors and other organisations are either creating or being swept up in the hype can be a major disruption to any organisation.  In our soon to be released research on Asia Pacific Trends for 2013 we highlight a number of disruptive trends that are affecting organisations all all types and sizes - whether commercial, government or not-for-profit. None is more profound than the impact that big data will have on Asia Pacific organisations in 2013. The Asia Pacific region has a very broad spectrum of capabilities, maturity and variations in its outlook and optimism. Big data and deep analytics are two areas where we see significant disruption occurring. The Asia Pacific 2013 trends report highlights some of these differences in Asia Pacific and calls out specific implications for specific markets. There's also more detailed information in our Big Data in Asia Pacific report, also due out shortly.

What has become clear is that APAC organisations are struggling with the disruptive forces of big data - whether they have actually implemented it or not. Disruptive technologies are often assumed to be disruptive because of the transformational benefits they might bring to those organisations that actually implement them. However, this research has highlighted that disruption exists simply because the  concept  exists. Whether the term relates to something physical or real (or not), it's still becoming disruptive to the organisation. We've seen this many times before - cloud computing, radio frequency identification tags ( RFID ), electronic market places - the list goes on. How companies choose to cope with this disruption...or how they attempt to challenge it head-on...is particularly interesting. For some, it's a case of complete denial - \"there's nothing new or different about this technology (or the problems that it's supposed to be solving)...so we don't need to do anything\". For others it's a case of failing fast and pushing the bounds of what is, or what is not, possible. Whether Big Data is the underlying driving force or not, really doesn't matter. It's a catalyst for change that brings a change in thinking, a change in organisational priorities and a change in operational and project budget allocations.

The questions were focused around whether users are still satisfied with dashboards, graphs and charts or do they have new needs, demands and expectations. Arguably, Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics were probably the first real \"commercial\" examples of data visualization (though many people before the Egyptians also used the same approach — but more often as a general communications tool). Since then, visualization of data has certainly always been both a popular and important topic. For example, Florence Nightingale changed the course of healthcare with a single compelling polar area chart on the causes of death during the Crimean War.  In looking at this question of how and why data visualization might be changing, I identified at least 5 major triggers. Namely: Increasing volumes of data.  It's no surprise that we now have to process much larger volumes of data. But this also impacts the ways we need to represent it. The volume of data stimulates new forms of visualization tools. While not all of these tools are new (strictly speaking), they have at least begun to find a much broader audience as we find the need to communicate much more information much more rapidly. Time walling and infographics are just two approaches that are not necessarily all that new but they have attracted much greater usage as a direct result of the increasing volume of data.

Many companies claim they are into Big Data, but what are they actually doing? In this post we use Treparel KMX text analytics software to analyze and visualize the activities of Big Data-related companies based on information from the CrunchBase and IFI Claims databases. This guest blog is written by: Enric Escorsa O’Callaghan PhD. CEO of  IALE Tecnologia  (Spain) Key Findings About 11.000 Crunchbase companies’ core business is related to managing big volumes of data, with software and enterprise as main areas of focus. Main Big Data application for Enterprises are Market Intelligence and analytics. Over 400 Crunchbase companies have patents on Big Data, in particular on software, mobile, analytics and security. The top five Big Data patent assignees are IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Huawei, and ZTE Corporation. IBM, Microsoft, and SAP focus on Big Data business management & analytics, whereas Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE Corporation on infrastructure Expanding Big Data application areas: health, energy and aircraft industries Chinese universities overwhelmingly dominating research centers Big Data patent activity. Who is working in Big Data? Many diverse actors play its role within the Big Data ecosystem: not only big companies used to handling big volumes of data, but also many new entrants such as web and software developers which have been able to identify new opportunities subjacent in Big data. Fig 1: Landscape of Big Data-related companies from Crunchbase, grouped by their activities. (Legend: Colors represent the Crunchbase category plus Amount of companies) (Click to enlarge) Considering the Big Data value chain’s associated levels, the list of actors can range from infrastructure developers, to search and data providers, analysts and up to those actually using Big Data solutions for specific applications. To find out what these companies are up to we first queried Crunchbase . CrunchBase is a reference database about technology based start-up companies, people and investors developed by Techcrunch, the leading media provider. From a general search, we found more than 11.000 companies whose main activity is related to managing big volumes of data. Ironically enough, the best way of analyzing this large data set is to use Big Data text analytics software, in our case Treparel’s KMX. Figure 1 shows a landscape plot of companies (colored dots) grouped by topics (labels) as referred in their own products and services specifications. A more detailed analysis of Big Data companies that are active in largest CrunchBase categories, software solutions and enterprise, can be found in the appendix below. Who owns Big Data technology? It is one thing to analyze what these companies say they do, another thing is what type of technology they actually patent. If we search CrunchBase for companies mentioning owned patents we end up with 449 hits (230 with patented technologies and 219 with patent-pending technologies). The main CrunchBase categories to which these companies belong are Software, Mobile, Analytics and Security. This can also be seen in a landscape plot of their activities listed in CrunchBase (figure 2). A complete list of companies can be found in the appendix section (at the end of this blog). Fig 2: Landscape of Big Data topics covered by patenting and patent-pending companies. (Click to enlarge) However, CrunchBase does not offer a complete picture of Big Data patents. Therefore, we also used KMX to analyze data-related patents from the IFIClaims, global patent database. Figure 3 shows a landscape plot of the areas covered by Big Data patents published worldwide in the last 10 years. The dots represent a single patent and the colored dots are patents owned by the most prominent assignees. This casts an interesting light on the technical vocabulary related to the technologies whose protection has been sought after. Fig 3: Landscape of areas covered by Big Data patents (publication years 2003-2013). (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) Top 5 Big Data patent assignees IBM tops the patent leaders list in the field; IBM’s top inventors (chief engineering manager Charles J Archer –now working at Intel- master inventor Michael Blocksome and software engineer Joe Ratterman –now working at Microsoft) account for an outstanding activity on data communication and parallel computing). Microsoft also counts more than 300 patents on Big Data, being some of them important applications in the areas of online advertisingand Business intelligence such as the ones held by its leading engineer Rajeev Prasad (now founder of Picube Labs). SAP also falls into the technology top players, with Chinese multinationals ZTE and HUAWEI following closely behind these historic leaders. Table C in the appendix shows the main topics patented by the top 5 leaders. We note strong, continuous and diverse R&D activity being carried out by all leaders, although Western companies seem to focus primarily on analytical and business management processes, whereas the Chinese multinationals on infrastructure technologies above all. More and more players in the Big Data ecosystem Oracle is another clear leader in Big Data related technology development. It has filed patents on business applications integration with enterprise management Systems, and on other subjects as diverse as: efficient storage of xml documents based on paths, determination of the need for electronic signature in transactions to a database, guided navigation Systems, backup storage methods, dynamic record methods for blocking data duplicates, prediction of costumer behavior, changes in ranking algorithms based on customer Settings, or in self-learning data lenses, amongst many others. We identify many other companies active in the field of Big Data. Apple , for example, owns patents on integrating structured and unstructured databases, on synchronization methods and Systems and dynamic data association and on protocols for transaction based Communications, amongst others.  CA Technologies has applied for protecting technologies on identification and generation of business events, processing mixed numeric and non-numeric data, data pack up and storage and dynamic query models. In fact, Google had pledged recently patents form IBM and CA Technologies, as announced in Techcrunch . The list of Big data technology players follows with companies such as HP (patents on analytical data processing, continuous querying of a data stream, resource assignments for jobs in a processing pipelines, etc.), Japanese multinationals such as  Fujitsu (patents on distributed data processing systems, memory management programs, database and search engine query systems, speech recognition methods, etc.),  Matsushita   (digital filters, image coding methods, digital filters, assistive call center interfaces, etc.) , Hitachi (storage server management), Toshiba (electronic documents recording) and NEC corporation (methods for estimating the load characteristics of a program and for categorizing unstructured data). Some of the companies we found in CrunchBase are indeed patent assignees with several registered patents on their counter (e.g. NTT, KLA Tencor, Mastech Group, Exalead, Hansen Technologies, McAfee, Dasan Networks, Qwest, Intermec, Eka Systems, Itron, Aster Data Systems Inc.). But we also found CrunchBase companies that do not mention patents in their activity description, while owning many (e.g. patenting on hadoop based technologies are: Maana KK, Cloudera Inc., Ravel, Evident Software inc, Rainstor Ltd, Platfora Inc., Mapr Technologies, Innovolt Inc., Zettaset Inc., Data Treasure Corp). A further analysis of recent patents can also be found in the appendix below. Surprising big data applications These patenting activities mostly fall in the areas we also found in CrunchBase. However we would like to mention a few notable but less obvious cases of specific Big Data applications. For example in Health Amanda Peters , a Lawrence Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has several patents filed on large-scale parallel applications to study research problems in areas ranging from cardiovascular disease to wireless networks to drug development . Canadian Wellpoint Systems , registers methods for computer-readable media managment of healthcare records. Meanwhile, the multinational Celartem , headquartered in Japan and with strong presence in China, develops management software solutions for the analysis and maximization of Energy and electrical power use . A field in which China Electric power is also active. An evidence of the application of Big Data to the aircraft industry is well represented by Boeing, that has recently registered several patents on intelligence analysis of unstructured data based on associative memory technology.

      "The Importance of IT Operations in the Big Data Era Advanced Analytics Cloud Customer Analytics Data Visualization IoT Data Management Operations eBooks Events Glossary University Map Use Cases Webinars Whitepapers The Importance of IT Operations in the Big Data Era by Bill Berutti   |    September 15, 2016 5:30 am   |   0 Comments Bill Berutti, President of the Cloud, Data Center and Performance Businesses, BMC The role of IT has changed dramatically over the last couple of decades. What once was considered by most executives to be a necessary cost center for deploying and fixing computers and networks has evolved to become a strategic value center that protects the organization, drives down costs, and generates revenue. Looking into a future of big data, digital transformation, and increasing security threats, IT’s role becomes even more critical. In a world where everything is connected and communicating, IT pros are overwhelmed, searching through torrents of data for meaningful insights that can give the business any advantage over competitors and protect its infrastructure, data, and employees. It’s a painful, time-consuming, and often manual process that, by the time the data is ready for analysis, is frequently irrelevant. A better approach to sifting through and exploring massive amounts of data isn’t just a nice-to-have, it’s an imperative in the 4 th Industrial Revolution. Here are three key ways that IT will create value for the modern enterprise. Security Operations IT is responsible for identifying, preventing and, if necessary, responding to the entire range of today’s security threats. This includes identifying inappropriate attempts to connect to the network, monitoring email and social media streams for potential phishing attacks, identifying zombie servers and databases that could be backdoor entry points for attacks, and making sure vulnerabilities are patched as quickly as possible. Success in meeting these challenges depends on IT’s ability to support real time and near-real-time analysis of huge amounts of data. Related Stories Pokémon GO and the Lessons for IT Teams. Read the story » Use Big Data Analytics to Improve IT Operations. Read the story » Make an Impact on Your Business Operations in Real Time. Read the story » Turn IT into a Profit Center with Operational Analytics. Read the story » Organizations also must close the “SecOps gap” between the activities of security and IT operations teams that can lead to unnecessary data loss, production downtime, and reputation damage. Christian A. Christiansen, Program Vice President, Security Products and Services, IDC, said , “In light of increasingly sophisticated threats, it is time to rethink the traditional, departmentalized, siloed approach to security. CIOs must hold both security and IT operations groups accountable for identifying and fixing issues quickly and integrate security and IT operations activities to further protect their organizations.” To accomplish this, CIOs must be willing to reinvent their processes and invest in big data tools that enable real-time analysis and threat detection. Security and operations teams must become more agile and move to a proactive security position for both cloud and on-premises systems. This enables the teams to more readily embrace key business initiatives related to digital transformation , Internet of Things (IoT), continuous delivery, and shadow IT . Business Enablement Success in the digital economy depends on speed, agility, and a great experience for customers, partners, and employees. IT must enable rapid and creative DevOps by supporting new tools and infrastructure transformation. It also must support big data customer analytics and new strategies for partner enablement that involve data transfer, and it must do all this while maintaining a highly reliable and stable business platform and a help desk capacity that ensures business users can do their jobs. Only by carefully and comprehensively monitoring and automating across all IT operations can IT pull off this critical balancing act. A customer recently told me that his goal in 2016 is to change the conversation he has with his business partners. Gone are the days of reporting on what happened in the past. He’s focused on the future. Specifically, he said, “I don’t want to tell people how fast I fixed a problem. I want to tell them what problems we prevented from impacting the business and what we are doing to tune the technology that supports our digital initiatives.” Now that an extraordinarily high speed of operations is critical to business success, revenue generation will be linked directly to IT’s ability to automate business processes and analyze big data across a highly reliable infrastructure. New Business Models With the digital transformation well under way, IT operations is now responsible for enabling completely new business models, including IoT services and selling products on a subscription basis. From embedding sensors in farm equipment and truck fleets for more optimal routing to selling razor blades and airline travel as subscription services, IT must support the real-time analysis of the huge amounts of field data required to offer these services. This challenge is compounded by the equally huge amounts of customer data required to understand what services customers actually need and how they are consuming them. For example: A global tire manufacturer is leveraging the power of big data and IoT to embed sensors in the tires they sell. The tire company then wants to provide this data as a managed service to vehicle manufacturers, component makers, and service centers, as well as to insurers and other stakeholders, creating a completely new business model based on data that opens and expands new markets.   A number of banks are now using mobile apps to transform the retail banking experience. They are eliminating branches and leveraging big data to personalize services and reduce fraud. IT is responsible for creating and maintaining the apps, ensuring the security of the system, and collecting and analyzing user data.   eBook: Boost your Bottom Line with IT Operations Analytics   In the big-data-mobile-social-cloud world of mobile-first and the IoT, IT doesn’t have to settle for being an enabler of business models. It can invent or reinvent them. To the extent that every company today must rely on its IT infrastructure to secure and support employee productivity, product creation and ideation, sales, partner programs, HR, finance, and more, a smart investment in IT’s big data and automation capabilities will deliver on the promise of digital transformation driving new frontiers of business.

Big data leaders in the life sciences have been developing an ever-richer fabric of information for every meaningful decision, with the potential to cut development costs and timeframes by up to 30%. Rather than silos of analysis and data, and isolated special-purpose tools, they have single, pervasive data lakes containing data derived from research, manufacturing, safety tracking, trials, and post-launch responses from doctors and patients. However, achieving those benefits have, until recently, been extraordinarily costly, time consuming and inherently incomplete because the information required by domain experts for breakthrough insights has been scattered across internal and external sources. Enter the Anzo Smart Data Lake®. It uses semantic graph technology to support timely, self-serve analysis on large collections of context rich, dissimilar data. This allows IT and end-users to combine diverse sources of structured and unstructured data, both internal and external, into a vast graph data knowledge network. Fill out the form to the right to download this whitepaper and learn how Life Sciences companies are applying data lakes across organizations, departments, functions, disciplines and product lifecycles, creating rich fabrics of information for use by everyone.

HPCC Systems also announced the upcoming availability of version 5.0 with enhancements to provide additional support for international users, visualization capabilities and new functionality such as a Juju charm that makes the platform easier to use. We decided to open-source HPCC Systems three years ago to drive innovation for our leading technology that had only been available internally and allow other companies and developers to experience its benefits to solve their unique business challenges,” said Flavio Villanustre, Vice President, Products and Infrastructure, HPCC Systems, LexisNexis. Big Data Success Examples from Customers HPCC Systems underpins the data services of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, with revenues of $1.4 billion. LexisNexis Risk Solutions creates data, risk, analytics and anti-fraud solutions for customers in the industries financial services, government, health care, insurance and retail. For example, using LexisNexis Identity Analytics and HPCC Systems to verify and authenticate the identities of customers applying electronically for public assistance benefits, the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) has saved more than $12 million in cost avoidance by preventing fraud and creating increased efficiencies within its first five months rolling out a statewide program. We are extremely pleased with the savings we’ve already realized in the short time our program has been implemented,” Florida DCF Office of Public Benefits Director Andrew McClenahan said. “We look forward to continuing to protect the identity of our clients and stopping fraud at the front door, making sure only those who truly need help receive it.” A Growing Ecosystem for HPCC Systems, 100% Open Source and Community Driven The HPCC Systems ecosystem has grown since the open source launch, with community members, partners, consultants, academia and customers. We have established an HPCC Centre of Excellence and are training engineers on this important technology, said Deva Senapathy, Regional head of Americas at Infosys Limited, a global leader in consulting, technology and outsourcing solutions. “This unique partnership will see us work closely with LexisNexis to jointly identify opportunities to bring the benefits of HPCC Systems to clients who want to unlock the power of the data within their organization.” Free, online training classes have helped community members learn the platform and the programming language called Enterprise Control Language (ECL) and be competitive in the job market. I learned how to clean and transform ‘Big Data’ with ECL, said Dora Pan as a student at Florida State University and now working at Comrise.  “After the training, I got the job offer. Now I use ECL to solve ‘Big Data’ problems every day in my work.  The training enriched my ‘Big data’ analysis knowledge.” HPCC Systems celebrates its third birthday in the form of software releases, user value-downloads, ongoing development, community forums and additions of developers. Highlights From the Last Year Thousands of downloads and installations External  community growth of 9 percent from 2012 to 2013 with top countries including USA, India, China, UK, France More than doubled users An Academic community with eight percent growth from 2012 to 2013 Thousands have completed instructor-led training Hundreds have completed online training since 2012 Thousands of forum posts; the most active being the ECL Developer forum with thousands of posts as a group More users drive innovation in areas of interest like visualization and machine learning functionality. One developer worked on integration with machine learning library in about two weeks without prior experience using HPCC Systems Enterprise Control Language (ECL). The integration, considered seamless from an ECL programming standpoint, represents approximately 100,000 lines of existing C++ libraries, uses embedded C++ wrappers, ECL macros and ECL functions. 5.0   Enhancements With community contributions from developers and analysts across the globe, HPCC Systems is offering translations and localization in its version 5.0 for languages including Chinese, Spanish, Hungarian, Serbian and Brazilian Portuguese with other languages to come in the future.

      "Reflections on UNFPA's Big Data Bootcamp | United Nations Global Pulse Skip to main content United Nations Global Pulse Harnessing big data for development and humanitarian action Search form Search Twitter Facebook Google+ YouTube Rss Feed About Projects Labs News Challenges Privacy Partnerships Resources Contact Home Subscribe to our newsletter Blog Reflections on UNFPA's Big Data Bootcamp René Clausen Nielsen Apr 27, 2015 The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) , recently convened a group of staff interested in big data. UNFPA is traditionally one of the more data-driven entities of the UN, and in his  statement (pdf) at the recent First Regular Session of the Executive Board, their Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin , laid out the establishment of UNFPA \"as a center of excellence in data for development\"  and highlighted that data for development is a corporate priority, and specifically mentioned the promise of big data for their work: Data is another priority area for UNFPA and a powerful tool for development. Data is essential to make evidence-based decisions and drive accountability. It can indicate whether our investments are making meaningful, measurable change in the lives of the most vulnerable. It can strengthen communities’ understanding of their own needs and assist people in holding decision makers accountable. This year UNFPA will focus on strengthening its strategic direction, internal capacity and key partnerships for data for development. Currently, the world knows the least about people who have the least – in other words, the very people we need most to reach. The data revolution and the promise of big data have particular resonance for our work to promote equity and human rights and ensure that all women, adolescent girls and young people everywhere are able to achieve their full potential. [...] Measuring progress towards the new Sustainable Development Goals will require a steady flow of high-quality, timely, authoritative, and accessible data. Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA Executive Director Against this supportive backdrop, 30 employees from all regions of the world and from every HQ division gathered in Barcelona, Spain where the Bootcamp took place. Also invited were 20 big data experts, including Global Pulse ( see full list of participant biographies ). The Big Data Bootcamp The bootcamp was hosted by event and co-working space  Betahaus  in Barcelona with technical support from  Data-Pop Alliance .  With great success, Betahaus introduced a \"design thinking\" methodology that sought to combine information sessions with brainstorming and creative solution-generation.  Day 1: Discovering Big Data On the first day, the agenda  focused on how UNFPA use and plan to use data, introductions to the concept of Big Data, and case studies of how it has previously been used for development. Global Pulse's Chief of Research, Miguel Luengo-Oroz, presented \" Applied Use of Big Data at the United Nations \", and we also presented 3 case studies: Understanding the Post-2015 Development Agenda through Social Media Main Post-2015 project website  / Uganda Post-2015 Dashboard Analyzing Social Media to Understand Attitudes towards Family Planning (with UNFPA Uganda) PPT Presentation / Live Dashboard Big Data for Climate Action Data for Climate Action Challenge / 2014 Climate Change Social Media Dashboard Day 2: Designing solutions with Big Data The second day was all about brainstorming about big data potentials for UNFPA around the world. Some groups based their discussions on a particular data source while others based their ideation on one of the thematic areas of UNFPA's work: Data Sources Call Detail Records (mobile phone data) Citizen reporting / crowd-sourcing Financial Transaction Data Physical sensors Online information Web Search   Thematic Areas Adolescents and Youth Gender, Human Rights, and Culture Humanitarian Population and Development Sexual and Reproductive Health   I can't speak to the other groups, but the work done and the lessons learned through this group engagement was quite phenomenal in the groups I led on: Online Information and Web Search Data. After this day's sessions we all understood better what it takes to do a big data project based on online data, when it can be expected to work and when not, and how it can best be of value to UNFPA country offices specifically. All groups came up with a potential UNFPA big data project and it really got creativity flowing. UNDP's Benjamin Kumpf tweeted this as they were looking at Financial Transaction Data: Building a prototype for mobile payments for girls' university attendance at #UNFPABigData w. @juka_ma @trevmon28 pic.twitter.com/C0XQG6iyMt — Benjamin Kumpf (@bkumpf) February 4, 2015   Later, we  performed our ideas which will surely feed into the UNFPA folklore: The @UNFPA gets 'betahaused' #UNFPABigData pic.twitter.com/WcmToEovKc — betahaus barcelona (@betahausbcn) February 4, 2015   Day 3: Defining The Future To round off the bootcamp, the last day looked towards the future of big data analysis in UNFPA. The morning was spent looking at every main aspect of the big data lifecycle, and how UNFPA could go about answering questions like \"Who should we partner with?\", \"How do we get access to data\", \"Do we hire or train internal data science capacities?\" , \"How do we best disseminate analytical results\", and \"How do we make sure results are used for policy change?\" The last hours were also spent in groups. One group analyzed and visualized some bootcamp participant data, while another group talked about how some of the proposed Sustainable Development Goals could be monitored using Big Data. The group I was in tried to hone in on UNFPA's vision for big data and feed into a UNFPA big data strategy. Our group settled on three areas to be described in the strategy : Partnerships : Partners with experience in (analyzing) big data and with interesting data are paramount to any success. Capacity Development : Without any current substantial in-house big data expertise, it is necessary to make sure to build on the initial learnings from the bootcamp, and make sure that a group of UNFPA employees at least know where big data can be used for what so that the above mentioned partnerships can be as strategically founded as possible, and leveraged fully. Do! : To get some early institutional learning, UNFPA can embark on pilot projects with current partners to try working through the main parts of a big data process.   Big Data: Learning, Exploring, Testing The format of the bootcamp turned out to be a great way of learning about a new topic in general, and big data in particular. The 3-step setup of \"Information\" --> \"Ideation\" --> \"Doing\" corresponds very well with the project initiation cycle we use at Global Pulse. As a result of the bootcamp, UNFPA is producing its 'Big Data Vision' with an outline underway, developing its internal culture and capacity and is taking forward plans for several big data prototype projects with partners. Finally, a data visualization app developed during the Bootcamp is now available for use by UNFPA in future meetings.

Microtrends are common to business management. A trend toward flexible workforces , for example, involves organizations minimizing their numbers of full-time employees and filling the gap with part-timers, freelancers and contract workers. The benefit of lower payroll and other staffing costs is compelling but the lack of readily accessible expertise can seem more so over time, stimulating a reversal of the trend. Similarly, trends like the results-only work environment ( ROWE ) and telecommuting are sometimes enthusiastically implemented but subsequently nipped in the bud because they fail to deliver the benefits that were expected. Malware development tends to self-limiting microtrends as well. As a given trend, such as ransomware , becomes more prevalent, potential victims become more aware of the risk and better able to protect themselves. Simultaneously, security experts develop better tools for preventing such attacks. All of this means that ransomware becomes less profitable, so malware developers move on to something else. The ability to perceive developing microtrends, through channels like social media , can yield significant competitive advantage. Microtrends contrast with macrotrends , which are more widely pervasive and persistent over a longer time frame, and megatrends, which are global and very persistent.   This was last updated in September 2016 Continue Reading About microtrend Trends in the workplace HP watches macro trends like globalization and urbanization About microtrends Emerging hacking trends worry seasoned security professionals Emerging tech trends point to new era of digital business Related Terms ad exchange An ad exchange is a software-based automated marketplace that allows publishers to sell their ad inventory and advertisers to bid...

Each of its core products has undergone a number of developments. Its main product now is Upstream Works for Finesse , which it classifies as a smart agent desktop. This is a desktop application that enables users of contact center systems to access the information and systems they need to resolve interactions, as well as prompting the user with next best steps to complete the interaction efficiently and effectively. Upstream Works has a close working agreement with Cisco so the product is only available for users of the Cisco Finesse product .

To address these issues, organizations need to  change how they use people and processes, and deploy innovative technologies that can support new initiatives. To provide an enterprise-wide solution, contact center systems fall into four categories: communications, business applications, analytics and self-service. Our benchmark research into next-generation contact center systems in the cloud  shows which types of systems companies have deployed, which they plan to deploy in the next 24 months and whether they prefer them to be on-premises or cloud-based.

BA is used to gain insights that inform business decisions and can be used to automate and optimize business processes. Data-driven companies treat their data as a corporate asset and leverage it for a competitive advantage. Successful business analytics depends on  data quality , skilled analysts who understand the technologies and the business, and an organizational commitment to data-driven decision-making. Business analytics examples Business analytics techniques break down into two main areas. The first is basic business intelligence . This involves examining historical data to get a sense of how a business department, team or staff member performed over a particular time. This is a mature practice that most enterprises are fairly accomplished at using. The second area of business analytics involves deeper statistical analysis . This may mean doing predictive analytics by applying statistical algorithms to historical data to make a prediction about future performance of a product, service or website design change. Or, it could mean using other advanced analytics techniques, like cluster analysis, to group customers based on similarities across several data points. This can be helpful in targeted marketing campaigns, for example. Specific types of business analytics include: Descriptive analytics , which tracks key performance indicators to understand the present state of a business; Predictive analytics, which analyzes trend data to assess the likelihood of future outcomes; and Prescriptive analytics , which uses past performance to generate recommendations about how to handle similar situations in the future. While the two components of business analytics -- business intelligence and advanced analytics -- are sometimes used interchangeably, there are some key differences between these two business analytics techniques: Business analytics vs. data science The more advanced areas of business analytics can start to resemble data science , but there is a distinction. Even when advanced statistical algorithms are applied to data sets, it doesn't necessarily mean data science is involved. There are a host of business analytics tools that can perform these kinds of functions automatically, requiring few of the special skills involved in data science. True data science involves more custom coding and more open-ended questions. Data scientists generally don't set out to solve a specific question, as most business analysts do. Rather, they will explore data using advanced statistical methods and allow the features in the data to guide their analysis. Business analytics applications Business analytics tools come in several different varieties: Data visualization tools Business intelligence reporting software Self-service analytics platforms Statistical analysis tools Big data platforms Self-service has become a major trend among business analytics tools. Users now demand software that is easy to use and doesn't require specialized training. This has led to the rise of simple-to-use tools from companies such as Tableau and Qlik, among others. These tools can be installed on a single computer for small applications or in server environments for enterprise-wide deployments. Once they are up and running, business analysts and others with less specialized training can use them to generate reports, charts and web portals that track specific metrics in data sets. Once the business goal of the analysis is determined, an analysis methodology is selected and data is acquired to support the analysis. Data acquisition often involves extraction from one or more business systems, data cleansing and integration into a single repository, such as a  data warehouse  or  data mart . The analysis is typically performed against a smaller sample set of data.  Analytics tools range from  spreadsheets  with statistical functions to complex data mining and predictive modeling applications. As patterns and relationships in the data are uncovered, new questions are asked, and the analytical process iterates until the business goal is met.  Deployment of predictive models involves scoring data records -- typically in a database -- and using the scores to optimize real-time decisions within applications and business processes. BA also supports tactical decision-making in response to unforeseen events. And, in many cases, the decision-making is automated to support real-time responses.  This was last updated in April 2017 Next Steps Expert Wayne Kernochan provides an overview of the different types of business intelligence analytics tools on the market.

Of course, that doesn't mean some organizations aren't trying. At the Gartner Data & Analytics Summit 2017 in Grapevine, Texas, analyst Alexander Linden said, \"We're seeing companies saying 'We are an AI company.' Some are even saying they're an AI-first company.\" This surely delights IBM, whose marketing for its cognitive platform Watson (which it ambitiously claims can think like a human) focuses on convincing businesses the time is right to become a cognitive business. Of course, any time a disruptive new technology comes on the scene, entrepreneurs and enterprising business executives will look for ways to exploit that technology. The Holy Grail is using new technology to create previously nonexistent business models. Uber took advantage of the ubiquity of mobile data and GPS services to create a new way for people to find rides. That innovation earned the company a couple years of virtually competitor-free growth, and an undisputed lead over the competitors who have since come along. Everyone is now wondering what kind of new business models cognitive computing technologies will spawn. Google might be one of the first companies to get there. It was nearly one year ago that CEO Sundar Pachai announced in a letter that the company would pursue an AI-first strategy . But, even with the advances in cognitive computing tools that we've seen in the 11 months since his letter was published, it doesn't make sense for the average enterprise to follow Google in this direction. The reason is that any sort of general-purpose AI is still a long way off -- despite what some marketing campaigns might say. What we have right now are tools that can effectively execute single tasks. This means that, while it may be possible for enterprises to turn some specific jobs over to the algorithms, it's hard to imagine any business, beyond a large information-based company like Google, benefitting from it in a broad way. That's one of the biggest takeaways from a new report out of MIT's Center for Information Systems Research. It says that narrowly defined tasks are the best use cases for today's cognitive computing tools. Good use cases today include things like banks evaluating customer creditworthiness, healthcare providers conducting insurance audits and accounting firms doing general audits. But the report , \"Five Things You Should Know About Cognitive Computing,\" states that any situation with high levels of uncertainty, rapid change or creative demands is not where AI thrives. The report recommends that enterprises proceed incrementally, applying cognitive computing technologies to areas where there are already strong business rules in place to guide algorithms, and large volumes of data to train the machines. Not every business meets those conditions -- certainly, few businesses have those conditions across the enterprise. So chasing the notion of becoming a cognitive business makes little sense right now. Next Steps Cognitive computing may help users make sense of big data Challenges of cognitive computing are more strategic than technical Cognitive technologies demand the right use case, good management This was last published in March 2017 Dig Deeper on Artificial intelligence and analytics All News Get Started Evaluate Manage Deloitte report reveals the power of unstructured data analytics Enterprises describe how they get value from their data science team Experts urge caution when evaluating marketing claims for AI tools Researchers work on AI algorithms to detect fake news Load More View All Enterprises describe how they get value from their data science team Experts urge caution when evaluating marketing claims for AI tools Industry responds to artificial intelligence technology development The future of AI apps will be delivery as a service View All News Reality check needed to assess AI applications View All Get started AI chatbot apps to infiltrate businesses sooner than you think Job losses from artificial intelligence software seen as unlikely Few artificial intelligence applications live up to the name View All Evaluate Deloitte report reveals the power of unstructured data analytics Researchers work on AI algorithms to detect fake news Reality check needed to assess AI applications Few artificial intelligence applications live up to the name View All Manage PRO+ Content Find more PRO+ content and other member only offers, here.

ICE defines an architecture and a common language that can be used as a means of automating Web content syndication (information sharing and reuse between Web sites) for publishing and e-commerce uses. Members of the ICE Authoring Group (which includes representatives from Adobe Systems, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Vignette, and National Semiconductor) are committed to the further development of ICE as an open standard. ICE version 1.1 was released in June 2000.

ICE enables the automation of data supplying, exchanging, updating, and controlling without requiring the supplier to manually package content, or to maintain knowledge about the structure of recipient Web sites. ICE specifies creation of a trust relationship based on the Open Profiling System (OPS). Use of the ICE protocol enables data sharing between servers, so that, for example, syndicated portions of a Web page can be automatically updated when the source is updated, or new content can be automatically entered and integrated with existing content on a Web page. Each protocol message between servers consists of a valid (conforming to namespace criteria) XML document. XML tags are used to format data to be processed by the servers involved in the transaction. Because ICE makes it possible for almost every aspect of B2B asset exchange to be automated, it decreases the need to maintain technical staff -often a scarce resource - for those purposes. Use of the protocol allows information service providers to specify content, customize it for specific recipients, schedule its delivery, and maintain it. Nevertheless, the success of content syndication is still reliant on the development of a standard metadata vocabulary, considered to be another essential element. The Publishing Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata (PRISM) working group (an organization made up of content providers and vendors) is collaborating to develop such a standard. This was last updated in September 2005 Continue Reading About Information and Content Exchange (ICE) The World Wide Web Consortium provides a document about ICE.

The models also examine when it's best to allow competition to divide the existing benefits among players in order to provide the leading competitors with more market share.  Download this free guide Download 9 FREE Strategic Planning Templates that your Peers Already Use Having a clear-cut IT strategy is key establishing a competitive advantage over any competition.

The coopetition model starts out with a diagramming process called the value net, which is represented as a diamond with four defined player designations at the corners. The players are customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors (competitors whose products add value). The goal of coopetition is to move the players from a zero-sum game, in which the winner takes all and the loser is left empty-handed, to a plus-sum game, a scenario in which the end result is more profitable when the competitors work together. An important part of the game is to learn which variables will influence the players to either compete or cooperate and when it is to a player's advantage not to cooperate.  Coopetition (also spelled co-opetition) is a portmanteau , combining the words cooperation and competition. The principles and practices of coopetition are credited to Harvard and Yale business professors, Adam M. Brandenburger and Barry J. Nalebuff. Competitive businesses that also cooperate when it is to their advantage are said to be in coopetition. This was last updated in March 2014 Continue Reading About coopetition (co-opetition) The Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce provides more information about co-opetition and games theory.

E-tailing began to work for some major corporations and smaller entrepreneurs as early as 1997 when Dell Computer reported multimillion dollar orders taken at its Web site. The success of Amazon.com hastened the arrival of Barnes and Noble's e-tail site. Concerns about secure order-taking receded. 1997 was also the year in which Auto-by-Tel reported that they had sold their millionth car over the Web, and CommerceNet/Nielsen Media reported that 10 million people had made purchases on the Web. Jupiter research predicted that e-tailing would grow to $37 billion by 2002. E-tailing has resulted in the development of e-tailware -- software tools for creating online catalogs and managing the business connected with doing e-tailing. A new trend is the price comparison site that can quickly compare prices from a number of different e-tailers and link you to them.

Enterprises have recently begun to treat their accumulated knowledge as an asset and to develop knowledge management plans and applications. A new kind of application, called data mining , attempts to develop knowledge from a company's accumulated business transactions and other data . In philosophy, the theory of knowledge is called epistemology and deals with such questions as how much knowledge comes from experience or from innate reasoning ability; whether knowledge needs to be believed or can simply be used; and how knowledge changes as new ideas about the same set of facts arise. This was last updated in April 2005 Continue Reading About knowledge There is a recently established International Society of Knowledge Organization that is concerned about organizing and retrieving knowledge on the Internet. Alexandre Sigel maintains The \"Knowledge Organization on the Internet\" MiniFAQ .

It is maintained by Gerry McKiernan at Iowa State University.

In the 2012 United States Presidential campaign, microtargeting techniques were successfully used to interact with and appeal to voters on an individualized basis. To achieve this type of personalization on such a massive scale, political campaign managers collected (and continually updated) detailed information about individual voters and used predictive analytics to model voter sentiment. Understanding the voting population on an individual level enabled campaign leaders to go beyond standard political party-oriented messages and communicate with voters about specific topics in order to influence the voter's decision.

      "Big Data: Are You Ready for Multimedia Information Systems? | Dr. Harish Kotadia About Me Big Data and Social Media News Travel and Photos Blog on Big Data and Analytics by Harish Kotadia, Ph.D. Big Data: Are You Ready for Multimedia Information Systems? July 29, 2012 by Harish Kotadia, Ph.D. 1 Comment If you take a look at Enterprise Information Systems that are currently in use, you will notice that they are very restrictive in nature in the sense that it is quite difficult to handle data types other than text or numbers. Moreover, text and numbers are handled using pre-defined (text and numbers) fields only in the database. It is extremely difficult to store/retrieve files of other data type like image or sound. This can be attributed to the fact that although we have seen remarkable changes in computing power, storage capacity and network speed/reach, the underlying database technology hasn’t changed much in the past two decades. Current generation of Enterprise Information Systems use  Relational Database Management Systems (or RDBMS for short). RDBMS is a Database Management System in which not only data is stored in tables, but relationships among the data are also stored in tables. RDBMS use Structured Query Language (or SQL) for managing data and SQL places data in well defined structures using meta data. Given three Vs of Big Data, namely Data Volume, Data Variety and Data Velocity, traditional data storage, retrieval and analysis tools/technology like RDBMS and SQL  are no longer going to work and we are going to leap frog into a new generation of technology that will fundamentally change the way data is stored, retrieved and analyzed. Big Data revolution has resulted in the development of a whole host of new tools and technology that can meet the challenge posed by three Vs of Big Data. For example, Not Only SQL (or NoSQL for short) doesn’t adhere to RDBMS model and is designed to capture all data without categorizing and parsing upon entry into the system. Using NoSQL and other tools such as HBase , Hive  etc., it is possible to store, retrieve, and analyze very large data sets of multiple data types not just text and numbers. As a result, we are about to enter into an era of multimedia enterprise information systems not only capable of handling very large data sets in real time but also capable of handling multiple data types like sound, video etc. Question is how many large and medium enterprises are ready for Multimedia Information (ERP or CRM) Systems? Not many in my opinion. What do you think?

January 7, 2010 No Comments January 27th, 2010 Every business, organization and government bodies are collecting large amount of data for research and development. Such huge database can make them to have the information on hand when required. But most important is that it takes much time to find important information from the data. “If you want to grow rapidly, you must take quick and accurate decisions to grab timely available opportunities.” By applying the process of data mining, you can easily extract and filter required information from data. It is a processing of refining data and extracting important information. This process is mainly divided into 3 sections; pre-processing, mining and validation. In pre-processing, large amount of relevant data are collected. The mining section includes data classification, clustering, error correction and linking information. The last but important is validate without which you can not make trust on information. In short, data mining is a process of converting data into authentic information. Let’s have look on how data mining is useful to companies. Fast and Feasible Decisions: To search information from huge bundle of data require more time. It also irritates a person who is doing such. With annoyed mind one can not take accurate decisions that’s for sure. By having help of data mining, one can easily get information and make fast decisions. It also helps to compare information with various factors so the decisions become more reliable. Data mining is helpful in every decision to make it quick and feasible. Powerful Strategies: After data mining, information becomes precise and easy to understand. While making strategies, one can easily analyze information in various dimensions. This analysis helps to get real idea about the strategy implementation. Management bodies can implement powerful strategies effectively to expand business boundaries. Competitive Advantage: Information is easily available and precise so that one can compare it with competitors’ information. It is very much required that you must compare the data otherwise you will have to suffer in business.

Event Registration Overview Agenda Location Speakers Sponsors Press Speakers Back Speaker \"Ashwini Kuntamukkala\" Details Name : ashwini kuntamukkala Company : Vizient Title : Software Architect Topic : Session 1: Data Wrangling - What, Why and How? [Industry state, business applicability]   Session 2: Transform your Enterprise into Data-Driven Digital Business Abstract : Session 1 : Abstract for \"Data Wrangling - What, Why and How? [Industry state, business applicability]\" \"Garbage in -> Garbage out (GIGO)\" is a popular  quote in the field of computer science. But is that really true? We are now nearing post \"Big Data” era where scaling data storage and compute capacity is almost as easy as pushing a button. The ecosystem of data processing tools is getting richer by the day. In such a thriving environment, data is not the new “oil\" but the new “soil” where companies can grow several data driven business models. Many forward looking companies are already unlocking the hidden insights in treasure troves of data they already have along with publicly available data. Just as gold is extracted from ore through a very rigorous refinement process, insights from data in the crudest form have to be discovered through rigorous process. This raw data is typically locked up in spread sheets, web pages, web/machine logs, PDFs, CSVs, TSVs, XML, JSON, images, videos, hand written notes, audio, RDFs, sensor signals, databases etc. One can’t perform accurate statistical analysis on inaccurate data. So, in order to facilitate effective use of raw data, there is an upsurge in the market place for plethora of tools that ease converting raw data into usable form. This process of converting raw data into usable form is called \"Data Wrangling”. After this iterative step of curated datasets, we can unleash rich analytics, visualizations etc to drive the end business objectives.  In this talk, I will cover the essentials of data wrangling, the necessary workflow, open source tools available at our disposal and also provide comparison among popular commercial vendors in this field based on my own experience and use cases.     Session 2 : Abstract \"for Transform your Enterprise into Data-Driven Digital Business\" Is your company in on “Digital Transformation”? This phenomenon is causing enterprises to rethink their strategy as they modernize themselves to stay relevant in an ultra competitive world. Darwin's quote “The fittest survive” is more relevant in business today than ever before. The enterprises that adapt and adopt this fundamentally a new “culture\" will disrupt their own business and stand the test of time. The reason I say “culture” instead of “strategy” is because Peter Drucker, father of modern management, has said that “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”. So in a company if the spirit of innovation, agility are missing, no disruptive strategy has a chance to work. So if you are someone who wants to be a change agent, a catalyst or a visionary so your company can create more value and enter a new growth spurt or a new market but are running into walls or culture that does not facilitate that, you can be frustrated like the driver trying to steer a parked car. In this talk, I will share my insights from my own experience and much of others that I have had a good fortune to collaborate with which will help you carve a successful digital transformation roadmap for your company. You will be empowered with practical insights, tidbits, and result oriented successful practices that you can take back and start your company’s \"digital transformation\"   Profile : Ashwini is a Software Architect focusing on Big Data and NoSQL initiatives.

They also provide opportunity to place data governance at the center of important business changes, according to participants in last week's Enterprise Data Governance Online 2017 webinar. Among the most challenging new developments is the data lake, which, in its most basic form, eschews upfront curation and categorization of data. Curation, which includes cleansing data and assuring its consistency, is among the hallmarks of the data governance process. Effective data governance can be applied to a Hadoop data lake, according to Shannon Fuller, director of data governance at Carolinas HealthCare System, based in Charlotte, N.C. The data-lake path was chosen for an innovative big data project, he said, because it could encourage more rapid application development and create a common repository, while protecting patients' information and the health system's intellectual property. \"We decided this would not be another data warehouse,\" Fuller said. \"It would be stand-alone assets available to the whole organization.\" He added that data can be made available for analysis more quickly by structuring and managing it in smaller chunks. For example, physician payment records are set up as a separate element in the data lake. One road to reports, another to sandbox Fuller said his organization is using a twofold path that prepares sets of curated data carefully for both business users and data scientists. Driving the project is Carolinas HealthCare's push to look at a patient's overall treatment plan, taking disparate data into account and making decisions on compensation models. Fuller described his operation as an IBM InfoSphere shop, but said the pilot data lake was accomplished using Microsoft's HDInsight and Azure Data Lake Store cloud services. Tresata software is used to catalog some of the source data, according to Fuller. Once treated and cleansed, data is then pushed back into the Azure Data Lake Store to be further analyzed, or to feed reports and executive dashboards. Separately, the curated data is made available in an analytics sandbox to data scientists, who can use HDInsight, Microsoft's R Server software and the Spark processing engine to build advanced analytical models based on the data. \"You have to ask, 'Do you want to govern the data going into the environment, or do you want to do it when it is in there?' We decided to bring in the raw data, land it in an operational layer and then curate it,\" Fuller said. The operational layer comprises raw data that is available to database administrators, sys admins and data integration developers creating extract, transform and load jobs. Fuller said data scientists and business analysts alike benefit from the availability of curated and more governed versions of the data. \"Understanding the context of data is very important,\" he said, noting that the health system wants to make sure different users work off of the same base of information so they get consistent results and correctly see connections between different data sets. Data stewards should pursue context Context can be a challenge for data stewards , too. They are the individuals charged to implement a data governance process. If they can understand the context of new innovations, data stewards can place data governance at the center of innovation in organizations, according to Fawad Butt, who also shared his views with EDGO 2017 conference attendees. \"Data stewards are the unit of execution for data governance. A lot of data governance programs spend a lot of time building their strategy and putting rules in place, but these are the folks that facilitate the enforcement of standards and policies,\" said Butt, chief data governance officer at Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare provider and insurer based in Oakland, Calif. To help grease the data governance and stewardship skids, Butt advised his audience to \"look for places where there is opportunity for transformation, or where there are already transformation alternatives underway,\" such as big data initiatives, business system updates and digitization strategies. \"You're already in the process of disrupting how things are done, anyway,\" he said. He also advised practitioners to walk around and learn the business they are in. As companies look to transform the way they work, that means keeping an eye on the business side of data. \"In order to discover the context you need to understand the environment you're in,\" Butt said. \"When [data stewards] are in the IT world, sometimes there is a focus on aligning stewardship with data sets that IT manages on a day-in, day-out basis. But perhaps there is an opportunity to also align with the major business units. There's a lot of traction that can be gained in doing that.\" Next Steps Be there as monitoring and governance come to Hadoop Learn how best to select data governance tools Ask the expert: How do you optimize master data management strategy?

      "Beyond Just “Big” Data - IEEE Spectrum Join IEEE | IEEE.org | IEEE Xplore Digital Library | IEEE Standards | IEEE Spectrum | More Sites Follow on: Advertisement Engineering Topics   Special Reports   Blogs   Multimedia   The Magazine   Professional Resources   Search   Opinion Computing Software Beyond Just “Big” Data We need new words to describe the coming wave of machine-generated information By Paul McFedries Posted 28 Jul 2015 | 19:00 GMT Advertisement Illustration: Greg Mably Data science is going to be as foundational to education as English... [It] doesn’t belong in the business school. Everybody should take data science. —Jennifer Priestly, Kennesaw State University When Gartner released its annual Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies for 2014, it was interesting to note that big data was now located on the downslope from the “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” while the Internet of Things (often shortened to IoT ) was right at the peak, and data science was on the upslope. This felt intuitively right. First, although big data—those massive amounts of information that require special techniques to store, search, and analyze—remains a thriving and much-discussed area, it’s no longer the new kid on the data block. Second, everyone expects that the data sets generated by the Internet of Things will be even more impressive than today’s big-data collections. And third, collecting data is one significant challenge, but analyzing and extracting knowledge from it is quite another, and the purview of data science. Just how much information are we talking about here? Estimates vary widely, but big-data buffs sometimes speak of storage in units of brontobytes , a term that appears to be based on brontosaurus , one of the largest creatures ever to rattle the Earth. That tells you we’re dealing with a big number, but just how much data could reside in a brontobyte? I could tell you that it’s 1,000 yottabytes , but that likely won’t help. Instead, think of a terabyte, which these days represents an average-size hard drive. Well, you would need 1,000,000,000,000,000 (a thousand trillion) of them to fill a brontobyte. Oh, and for the record, yes, there’s an even larger unit tossed around by big-data mavens: the geopbyte , which is 1,000 brontobytes. Whatever the term, we’re really dealing in hellabytes , that is, a helluva lot of data. Wrangling even petabyte-size data sets (a petabyte is 1,000 terabytes) and data lakes (data stored and readily accessible in its pure, unprocessed state) are tasks for professionals, so not only are listings for big-data-related jobs thick on the ground but the job titles themselves now display a pleasing variety: companies are looking for data architects (specialists in building data models), data custodians and data stewards (who manage data sources), data visualizers (who can translate data into visual form), data change agents and data explorers (who change how a company does business based on analyzing company data), and even data frackers (who use enhanced or hidden measures to extract or obtain data). But it’s not just data professionals who are taking advantage of Brobdingnagian data sets to get ahead. Nowhere is that more evident than in the news, where a new type of journalism has emerged that uses statistics, programming, and other digital data and tools to produce or shape news stories. This data journalism (or  data-driven journalism ) is exemplified by Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight site, a wildly popular exercise in precision journalism and computer-assisted reporting (or CAR ). And everyone, professional and amateur alike, no longer has the luxury of dealing with just “big” data. Now there is also thick data (which combines both quantitative and qualitative analysis), long data (which extends back in time hundreds or thousands of years), hot data (which is used constantly, meaning it must be easily and quickly accessible), and cold data (which is used relatively infrequently, so it can be less readily available). In the 1980s we were told we needed cultural literacy. Perhaps now we need big-data literacy , not necessarily to become proficient in analyzing large data sets but to become aware of how our everyday actions—our small data — contribute to many different big-data sets and what impact that might have on our privacy and security. Let’s learn how to become custodians of our own data.

With the recent announcement that it would be selling its machine learning technology to the public, Amazon Web Services joined Microsoft and Google in their race to bring cheap and easy-to-use machine learning to everyone. Introduced as Amazon Machine Learning, the product will offer similar features to Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning , Google's Prediction API and other machine learning services. These features include analyzing user data to look for patterns and generate predictive models, providing expectations of likely customer churn or turnover, detecting customer support issues, and auto-classifying documents and product reviews. Despite the complex capabilities, the goal of many of these services is fairly simple -- to make machine learning more accessible not only to every enterprise, but to everyone.

Individuals walk around with far more computing power and data storage in their pockets than was required to send men to the moon. People routinely hold on their laps what would have been considered a supercomputer a generation ago. There is a wealth of information available on the Web. And the costs of these information assets are a tiny fraction of what they were decades ago. Consumer products have been at the forefront in utilizing information technology capabilities. The list of innovations is staggering. The “smart” phone is positively brilliant. Games are now a far bigger business than motion pictures. Yet few business users are tapping the full potential of today’s systems. Most organizations have been slow to integrate IT innovation into their core processes. Companies have made considerable investments in information technology, but their business methods have been slow to adapt to the resources available. For instance, software for incentive compensation software and for planning and budgeting has made it possible to improve these processes, but most companies manage compensation, budget and plan in much the same way they did decades ago. To be sure, it’s much easier for individuals to adopt new tools for themselves than it is to align groups and executives in corporations to change proven approaches – even mediocre ones. But it’s also the case that business software must make it easier for individuals to realize more of the potential of information technology. And this part of the evolution of business software is only beginning. This is the context in which I took note of two emerging capabilities of IBM’s business software. One is its Concert user experience software and the other its emerging application (not yet officially named) designed to make advanced analytics more consumable. These are two important capabilities IBM highlighted at its recent Insight user group meeting and Big Data and Analytics analyst summit. Integrating processes and data across a business has long been a challenge for IT departments. Some decades ago the issue of “islands of automation” emerged as companies implemented stand-alone business applications one by one to perform some function but then realized that it would be handy if these could share data and manage processes from start to finish. Initial progress toward this goal was made in the form of applications such as ERP that offer integrated functionality and enterprise data stores, although these often were difficult to implement and complex to maintain. Lately, software vendors have been refocusing to provide users with ways of facilitating end-to-end process management and making data more accessible. IBM Concert  is such an attempt. Announced in November 2013, it is a user interface IBM designed to be the central touch point across multiple applications and data stores. (It’s possible to link Concert to other vendors’ software, but it’s unlikely that a company would buy it on its own to link other applications.) It’s meant to replace menu-driven interactions between the user and the system with “I want to do this process” and a “day in the life” approach to organizing how individuals access applications and data. IBM Concert is an example of how we are only now beginning to achieve the longstanding objective of having  IT systems conform to the user’s needs  rather than the opposite. On a single screen Concert organizes personal task lists and presents metrics, conditions and dashboard elements configured to an individual’s preferences so the user can easily monitor conditions and enable more management by exception. Users can organize the data they need to support a given process right in front of them rather than having to go to some other application to fetch that data. IBM Concert also has a social component that provides the ability for users to collaborate in context. Social applications generally have improved organizations’ connectedness. They offer greater immediacy than “copy all” email, greater inclusiveness than chat software and better communication in a mobile and geographically dispersed workforce. Initially, social applications took a broadcast approach similar to an unfiltered Twitter feed but as I pointed out at the time, that wasn’t a useful approach. As anyone who has used Twitter during an event can attest, the volume of messages quickly exceeds one’s ability to pick out the important ones. Moreover, not everyone wants to share information broadly,  especially, for example, finance departments . Concert by contrast “understands” the area in which the individual is working and connects him or her to the conversations of others who are part of the group that needs to collaborate on that specific task. Users also apply hashtags to add a specific context to the message. I think that Concert has the potential to become the nexus of business people’s computing environments and a sidekick that helps them stay organized and informed, get alerts, collaborate, find answers and explore their workday world. Both at Vision and again at the Big Data and Analytics analyst summit, IBM previewed Project Catalyst Insight which is a not-yet-named application that is a significant advancement from its SPSS Analytic Catalyst software. Making big data and analytics more useful and consumable by the white-collar workforce (and even some of the blue collars) would be provide a major boost to organizational performance. By itself, a mass of data is not especially useful, and there are significant challenges to teasing out insights from large data sets, especially when that requires sophisticated analytical techniques. Another as-yet-unnamed application from IBM is designed to make big data and analytics more consumable and more useful. Typically large volumes of data are now accessible mainly to those with Ph.D.s in statistics or otherwise highly trained. The main objective of this project is to package advanced analytics routines for use, after limited training, by ordinary business analysts working in any department in any industry. Big data has always been with us; it is just a question how much “big” is. Today the term refers to data sets so large and complex that organizations have difficulty processing them using standard database management systems and applications. Technology for handling big data has crossed a threshold, becoming more capable and cost-effective. Companies can now to tap into much larger amounts of structured and unstructured data. Big data has potential – and potential pitfalls – for improving a company’s performance,  as I have noted . Big data is of little use unless organizations have the ability to use analytics to achieve insights not available through more conventional techniques. The ability to sift through large quantities of business-related data rapidly could set in motion fundamental changes in how executives and managers run their business. Properly deployed, big data can support a more forward-looking and agile management style even in very large enterprises. It will allow more flexible forms of business organization. It can give finance organizations greater scope to play a more strategic role in corporate management by changing the focus of business reviews from backward-looking assessments of what just happened to emphasis on what to do next. The challenge for many companies is that big data and advanced analytics are not readily consumable.  Our research on finance analytics  finds that fewer than one-third (29%) of companies use big data to support their finance analytics, even though this technology can handle the flood of data into today’s businesses and can help produce more useful analytics and advanced techniques. Although analytics is essential to finance departments, their focus remains on the basics. Fewer than half (44% each) use the proven newer techniques of predictive analytics and leading indicators. Nearly three out of four (73%) do not assess relevant economic or market data and trends, and fewer than half assess customer and product profitability; any of these could make analyses more relevant to the overall success of the company. The ability of finance organizations to master analytical techniques – especially advanced ones – ought to be a priority for senior executives because our research shows a correlation between competence in utilizing big data and analytics and the ability to adapt quickly to changing business and economic conditions. IBM SPSS Analytic Catalyst Insight is designed to make it easier for business users who are not trained statisticians to create predictive analytical models just by answering a few preliminary questions about what they want to accomplish using the data. The new incarnation with IBM Project Catalyst Insight aims to simplify the process even further to bring it into the reach of a wider set of business users. It does so by packaging a range of standard routines that would be applied to data sets and providing even more guidance to analysts and even some business managers that know what they want to know but have a limited grasp of the analytical techniques necessary to find meaning in a mass of data. If IBM can create an application that enables more business users to utilize predictive analytics and other advanced analytical techniques, it would represent a big step forward in making big data a useful tool for many more functional areas than it is today. Both IBM Concert and the new business analytics tool called Project Catalyst Insight “to be officially named later” reflect IBM’s strategy of achieving product differentiation in a rapidly evolving software market. The first decades of packaged business applications were characterized by a race to create new categories and load them with distinguishing features and functions. In the next decade competitive advantage will fall to software vendors that – in addition to features and functions – can provide business people with a user experience that is easily molded to how they naturally work. IBM Concert is a useful first step that is likely to be further refined. The new analytical environment derived from IBM SPSS Modeler and SPSS Analytic Catalyst Insight looks and sounds like a good idea, and it will be interesting to see how it develops when it is generally available.

During a roundtable discussion at the 2015 Pacific Northwest BI Summit in Grants Pass, Ore., Claudia Imhoff, president of consultancy Intelligent Solutions Inc., said she sees a lot of data visualizations that present \"incredibly artistic views of information\" but are unintelligible to corporate executives and other business users. \"At some point, it's overkill,\" Imhoff said. \"Yeah, they're pretty, but what does it mean?\" Successfully managing the data visualization process is especially challenging in big data analytics applications . In a survey conducted earlier this year by research and education outfit TDWI, only single-digit percentages of 374 respondents described their organizations as very successful at doing visual analysis of various forms of big data, including Hadoop files, sensor data, information stored in NoSQL databases and social media data. And in each of those cases, the combined percentage that said their companies were very or somewhat successful at analyzing and visualizing big data was less than 30%. Chart design overload isn't the only issue holding companies back in using big data visualization tools and techniques effectively. On another question in the TDWI survey, 338 respondents cited a variety of barriers standing in the way of their efforts to access, analyze and visualize Hadoop and NoSQL data, including a lack of both skills and business interest (see chart). But it isn't just big data: The responses to a third question showed only \"moderate success in using data visualization functionality\" to improve the overall analytics process in organizations, TDWI analyst David Stodder wrote in a report published in July. For some business intelligence and analytics managers, the quest to do better than that on data visualization projects involves a heavy dose of input from the business users who are the intended audience for charts, graphics and dashboards. Keeping visualization users in mind For example, to help guide his team's development of reports and BI dashboards with embedded data visualizations, Chris Gray, IT director at Swiss Farm Stores, a chain of 13 drive-thru grocery stores in the Philadelphia area, works closely with business managers to assess and update their information needs. At the outset of each new project, Gray sits down with the heads of departments who will use what he's planning to build. And then he continues to follow up after the initial development work has been completed, reconvening with the department heads every three to six months. At those meetings, he gauges how end users have taken to different elements of a report or dashboard and checks on opportunities for additions or modifications that could make it more informative or easier to use. We value our users' input, and that's a strong feeling of mine, to involve the users in the process. Chris Gray IT director, Swiss Farm Stores The reports and dashboards provide views of sales and purchasing data pulled from the ERP system at Swiss Farms, as the company – based in Broomall, Pa. -- refers to itself; the former are primarily used by its executive team, while the latter offer more on-the-fly information for store managers. Involving the eventual users in development planning for the data visualization process helps ensure that what gets delivered is relevant to the business and actually gets used, Gray said. And ultimately, he added, he has to trust his users to know their needs and be able to articulate them. For Gray, that doesn't necessarily mean asking them to fill out a lengthy technical spec sheet -- it just requires talking to them about how new data visualizations could help them do their job more effectively. \"We value our users' input, and that's a strong feeling of mine, to involve the users in the process,\" he said. Gray also tries to tailor visualizations to specific job functions by breaking out targeted versions of reports and dashboards for individual store managers, executives and department supervisors. Without that level of specificity, visualizations can become cluttered and less useful, he said. \"Data that looks meaningful to one store may not look meaningful to others. Once you have a graph but then clog it up with [too much data], it isn't as useful.\" Visual appeal matters in visualizations Dewayne Washington, BI manager at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport, takes a slightly different approach to managing the data visualization process, giving the developers on his team leeway to treat functionality requests from business users as a guide instead of must-do mandates. But he also has the developers sit with users or follow them around the airport while they do their jobs to help get a better idea of their data and visualization needs. Washington puts a big emphasis on how reports and dashboards look as well -- the result of a lesson in data visualization process best practices that he learned the hard way. The BI team's biggest internal customer is DFW's office of revenue management, which is responsible for making sure that retail stores, restaurants, parking operations and other airport services are profitable. Washington said his team used to just deliver reports in whatever form the requests came in from workers in the department. But that led to trouble when the executive vice president of revenue management or other top officials wanted to review several different reports. For example, revenue increases were shown in blue in some and black in others. The lack of consistency in how metrics were presented often left executives confused when they looked at reports, he noted. To address that problem, the BI team instituted a set of internal standards for data visualizations , ensuring that the colors used in charts and other graphical elements are consistent. That has enabled busy airport execs to make better use of what the team builds, Washington said. \"It may sound very trivial, very simple, but it did wonders for our executives.\" In addition, he has a staff member referred to as \"the beautifier,\" whose sole job is to take reports and dashboards developed by other workers and make them more visually appealing. \"It has to be beautiful,\" Washington said, adding that there's a practical reason for the focus on eye-catching design: He thinks it makes the end products of the data visualization efforts more useful.

With the rise of digital business and data-driven decision making , data storytelling has become a much-talked-about skill often associated with the data science and analytics community. The idea is to connect the dots between sophisticated data analyses and decision makers, who may not have the ability to interpret the data. To date, there is no set of best practices on how to tell compelling data stories, but experts often describe data storytelling in traditional storytelling terms, which include a \"hook\" or a device to draw the listener or reader in, themes, the use of emotion and a conclusion or a set of conclusions.

Some experts, such as Tom Davenport, analytics thought leader and professor of information technology and management at Babson College, emphasize the importance of the narrative -- no matter the medium. \"Narrative is the way we simplify and make sense of a complex world. It supplies context, insight, interpretation -- all the things that make data meaningful and analytics more relevant and interesting,\" he wrote in \"Why data storytelling is so important -- and why we're so bad at it,\" which was published in January 2015. Other experts, such as consultant Howard Dresner, describe data storytelling as a set of features within visualization tools that enable a more interactive experience with the data. \"What if I simply want to send you a presentation and have you go through it and understand a point I'm trying to make? That's where data storytelling can be useful. And many of the business intelligence tools are now including some semblance of data storytelling features for exactly that purpose,\" he told SearchCIO.com in \"Data storytelling is the next big thing in collaborative computing ,\" which was published in July 2015. Examples of data storytellers in the workplace are beginning to emerge. Pamela Peele, chief analytics officer at UPMC's insurance services division in Pittsburgh, hired a journalist to take on data storytelling responsibilities. At the other end of the spectrum, Automated Insights has developed technology that turns data, such as statistics from a baseball game, into Associated Press wire stories; the company soon hopes to provide a similar service for business departments, where it would turn sales or marketing data into news stories.

While traditional information technology strategies tend to focus on long-term road maps and budget forecasts that extend years into the future, digital strategies tend to rely on short-term, month-to-month road maps that are tied to actionable items and measurable business objectives. To be successful, the strategy should place focus on where the company value chain is vulnerable to disruption and could be made stronger and more economically viable from a digital reboot. One of the challenges for establishing a digital strategy is to figure out which services should be done in-house, which services should be outsourced to a third-party provider and which services require customization in order to be effective. In some companies, the CIO is in charge of both customer-facing initiatives and the back-end infrastructure that supports them. In other companies, however, a Chief Digital Officer (CDO) may be appointed to create and execute strategies and provide management with data that demonstrates how digital initiatives are adding value to the company. Either way, a digital strategy should be customer-focused and address ways to improve the company's social media footprint, organic search results, customer engagement and brand recognition. It should also include strategies for reputation management. Useful digital tools for evaluating the success of a digital strategy include Cognos , Compete, Alexa , Google Analytics , Facebook analytics and SproutSocial.

The explosion of data – and what can be done with it – has been the most transformational trend to emerge from the digital age. It is also the area where the most groundbreaking technology has been developed. The pace of innovation in this industry has been rapid, with new ways of generating insight from data springing up regularly. Big data is projected to grow to a £50.1 billion market this year, according to Wikkbon. Organisations have responded by creating roles like the chief data officer, chief analytics officer or chief data scientist to identify how such opportunities can be applied to relevant business scenarios, and to oversee the processes, tools and governance around them. Those filling these roles, as well as traditional IT leaders like CIOs and others involved in the deployment of big data technologies, have shown just how impactful they can be in improving services, driving efficiencies and cost savings, and trailblazing new opportunities for growth. And while it’s easy to dwell on the ‘sexier’ examples of big data, other cutting-edge technologies have enabled unprecedented ways to build infrastructure that can house and scale its growth – and protecting sensitive information from ever-expanding cyber threats is also a critical consideration. All functions involved in driving data innovation in the UK were considered for a Data 50 accolade, whether it be the vendors creating the technology, the end-users deploying it, or the consultants and integrators helping them do it. All of the following Data 50 winners will be presented with their trophies and celebrated by hundreds of the industry’s top players at  The Data 50 Awards  on 25 February 2016 at the Grand Connaught Rooms, London. The evening ceremony will also reveal the winners of ten special ‘Best in Class’ categories. The Data 50 list below shows which category each winner will compete it. The winners of these categories will be decided by a panel of judges, each a prominent data leader in their own right.

PMML support is growing rapidly. From down under and into the stars! Like it? 98 comments 0 Posted June 4, 2010 Keywords : business intelligence , data mining , modeling , pmml , Data Mining , Predictive Analytics , Business Intelligence Back in November 2009, I reported on PMML and Open Source Data Mining , highlighting the support open source tools offered for PMML. It is obvious that open source tools for predictive analytics are gaining more and more momentum. Just last month, the KDNuggets.com website ran a poll which asked visitors to vote for the tools they had used for a real project in the last 12 months. The result ... more than 50% of the respondents said they used open-source tools such as R, KNIME, and RapidMiner. Now, it may be that the responses are really not that representative of the entire data mining community, but they do reflect a trend: open source data mining tools are here to stay and their use is growing as they become better and easier to use. And, guess what? Their support for PMML is stronger than ever. Rapid-I has just released an extension for RapidMiner offering the export of PMML for several modeling techniques. KNIME continues to expand its PMML support with new capabilities ... and Weka has just announced support for Support Vector Machines (in addition to several other PMML elements). Augustus from Open Data supports segmented models expressed in PMML. The Zementis PMML Converter tool, which unifies the different versions of PMML into a single version is now also a corrector and it will soon support PMML 4.0. There is also news from commercial vendors, Pervasive has announced support for PMML in DataRush. The Zementis ADAPA decisioning platform which is available as a service on the Amazon Cloud now offers the seamless integration of models expressed in PMML and business rules. Last but not least, the Data Mining Group (DMG), which is responsible for developing PMML is constantly expanding. NASA has recently joined the DMG, so chances are PMML will grow out of this world and into the stars. According to the DMG website (dmg.org): \"The NASA Data Mining & Trending Working Group (DMTWG) was established to strengthen data/text mining and trending within and across NASA datasets, to aid in the identification and mitigation of adverse trends and to raise the awareness and capability of data/text mining within the agency. \" From down under, Togaware has also joined the DMG. Togaware's most well known product is Rattle, an open-source data mining tool built on top of R that produces and consumes PMML. Togaware maintains the PMML package for R which can be obtained from CRAN, the free \"app store\" for R users.

Innovation and Robotics: The Uncanny Valley of Death Like it? 174 comments 0 Posted May 30, 2012 Keywords : Policy and Governance The Jetsons premiered almost 50 years ago, but where’s Rosey? Science fiction has been predicting the rise of robotics in daily life for decades and, for the most part, science fact has delivered, with ever-improving artificial intelligence driven by faster processors, and continued advancements in mechanical engineering allow machines to perform increasingly complex physical functions. The White House National Robotics Initiative announced last year that “robotics technology is reaching a ‘tipping point’ and is poised for explosive growth because of improvements in core technologies such as microprocessors, sensors, and algorithms.” Still, outside of very limited and niche uses, such as assembling machinery on factory floors or vacuuming dirt from living room floors, autonomous machines have little impact on our daily lives, and the much-promised robot revolution (or apocalypse) still seems a long way off. One way to explain robots’ failure to launch is through the study of other disruptive technology. For the moment, there are several innovation trends working against them – they are stuck in the Uncanny Valley of Death. A “funding gap” or “Valley of Death” is a firmly established concept in investment and innovation studies. Simply put, all innovation begins with basic research, which aims to increase understanding and is undertaken out of curiosity rather than a specific commercial application. While basic research doesn’t generate revenue on its own, it is typically well funded by universities looking to advance knowledge and government initiatives which recognize its vital role in advancing technology. Research only begins to turn profitable on its own during commercialization, when new discoveries become products and can be monetized. Between these stages, however, there is a point where government funding tapers off but risk remains too high and rewards too obscure for private funding to kick in. While various iterations of this progression have been proposed from different perspectives, this point in research is considered the “Valley of Death” because so many potential innovations fail here, no longer cutting edge enough for university and government support but not yet sufficiently viable for profit-maximizing corporations. In many ways, this is where robotics is floundering. We don’t currently have the technology to build Rosey, the Jetson’s robot housekeeper, to be affordable or useful. Yet we can build highly mobile, highly functional humanoid robots and have developed fairly advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning. The closest we’ve come to a robot housekeeper, however, has been the Roomba , while sporadic attempts at humanoid household robots have been more novel than practical and prohibitively expensive. The same is true for most of the applications for robots we see in fiction. Unfortunately, the only way to develop robots that are functional and cost effective is to keep developing ones that aren’t, which government, academia, and industry are rarely willing to fund. Another effect at work is the “Uncanny Valley”, which is hypothesized to account for the discomfort humans beings feel around realistic robots and animations. While we’re comfortable with robots that are clearly mechanical and look nothing like us, when we see artificial beings that seem almost alive, we don’t like it. Though this is typically used to refer to appearance, I believe it also applies to behavior. We don’t like it when robots perform human functions, even when they are fully capable. This can be seen in some of the poorly defined outrage at drone warfare. Drones are neither autonomous not unprecedented, raising few moral issues that technologies such as cruise missiles have not brought up, and yet have seen a massive domestic moral backlash. In part, this is because we are uncomfortable with robot planes that look and behave like manned ones, even bombing human targets. The same goes for proposed future functions. Robot doctors, for example, could allow the worlds best specialists to operate on patients from across the world, but few would currently opt to be cut open by a robot arm, no matter who was controlling it. Would you let a robot watch your kids or take care of your grandparents? One of the reasons robots have stayed on the factory floor is that this most want to keep them there. The Department of Defense, however, still believes in the potential for robots to do better work faster and cheaper for America, and has recently launched two programs to bridge this Uncanny Valley of Death. The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has announced a  “grand challenge” for robot builders  offering a $2 million prize for robots that can use human tools for disaster response. While a human form isn’t required, DARPA offers a humanoid platform to entrants. Are we ready for robot first responders capable of climbing ladders, navigating over rubble, and using hand tools? If DARPA’s grand challenge makes you uncomfortable,  the Naval Research Laboratory opening a   Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research  (LASR) will terrify you. Among the projects LASR hopes to pursue are autonomous robot firefighters and unmanned underwater vehicles. Government funding is the typical method for overcoming gaps in investment caused by market forces (the Valley of Death) and biases (the Uncanny Valley) but it’s insufficient alone. For robots to take off as the likes of Isaac Asimov predicted, they will need to stand on their own or else be stuck in the same rut as alternative energy, which depends on heavy subsidies and tax breaks. Only time will tell whether robotics will overcome the Uncanny Valley of Death to become a real disruptive technology. This post by AlexOlesker was first published at CTOvision.com .

Hackers and Honeypots: Getting Things Done Like it? 236 comments 0 Posted June 10, 2012 Keywords : Cyber Security , Security , Commentary It’s always been fashionable in the cybersecurity industry to throw up our hands and call cyber crime an intractable problem. We don’t have the technical skills to match hackers, attribution is impossible in cyberspace, we don’t have the legal framework for Internet crimes, or international cooperation is insufficient to go after the shadowy, transnational cabal of cyber criminals. When I hear this cyber defeatism, I wonder which of these computer crime pundits have any experience with the broader field of criminal investigations. Attribution isn’t only a challenge when a criminal breaks into a computer network, it’s difficult in any sort of break in. Up to 50% of residential burglaries go unreported in the United States and those that are have a clearance rate of less than 15%.  Sometimes even having a picture of the burglar doesn’t help . And if you think examining malware to find its author is difficult, try getting incriminating information out of a violent gang with no tolerance for snitches. Yet while many of these issues remain challenges in regular policing, we’ve developed investigative methods that generally keep crime in check and give citizens a reasonable expectation of law and order. There’s no reason we can’t do the same in cyberspace, often with similar methods involving informants, undercover operations, forensics, and detective work. One great example of this was the honeypot that brought two Romanian hackers accused of stealing millions from American credit cards to the U.S. for prosecution. From 2008 to 2011, four Romanian hackers were accused of making millions of dollars of purchases with the stolen credit card data of 80,000 customers in the United States. As is typical for most organized cyber crime, their operation wasn’t particularly sophisticated. They scanned for vulnerable commercial point-of-sale  or “checkout” computer systems which store your credit card information for tips and processing, then either guessed or cracked their passwords to gain access, all of which can be done with tools available on the black market for download. Though all four men were indicted, only one was extradited from Romania, leaving the Secret Service, which investigates major fraud for the Department of Treasury, to somehow bring the others in to the United States themselves. While one of the hackers remains at large, the Secret Service successfully brought two into the country using a female agent as a honeypot. In espionage, a honeypot refers to an agent or plan that uses seduction as bait for entrapment, and is one of the oldest and most successful tricks in tradecraft. Working with a Hawaiian resort and casino, a female Secret Service agent pretended to be an employee offering one of the men a free weekend getaway after they developed a rapport. She convinced him that, having learned of his online gambling, the casino wanted to bring the Romanian in to establish a cosmopolitan feel, and that, she was really hoping to meet him in person. Her story checked out – the casino gave her an official email address and phone number at the resort and even bought the ticket. But when 27-year-old Iulian Dolan landed in the United States with, as his public defender recounts , “some clothes, a cheap necklace, a little bit of money, and three very large boxes of grape-flavored Romanian condoms,” he was immediately taken into custody. For the second hacker,26 year-old Cezar Iulian Butu, the Secret Service launched an even more targeted honeypot operation.  By subpoenaing Yahoo!, GoDaddy and other communications providers, they obtained Butu’s emails and used information on his travels, friends, and routine to impersonate an attractive female tourist he met in France a year earlier. Despite their in-depth information, the USSS didn’t need to make their story particularly believable for it to work, claiming to be an independently wealthy Hooters waitress working at the restaurant chain for the health insurance and a love of people. That was enough to get him to fly to Boston to meet her, where he was arrested on the spot. As the FBI’s veteran cyber cops have noted, that’s how you get things done. Investigating cyber crime is rarely a pure battle of wits between white hat and black hat hackers. Neither arrest required advanced technical expertise or capable and willing international partners, Since Internet criminals are most often petty gangsters, traditional investigations buttressed by subject matter experts and some forensic specialists with a background in code rather than ballistics can be effective at combatting cyber crime. Just as with any crime, challenges persist, but they are not as insurmountable or revolutionary as naysayers would have you believe. This post by AlexOlesker was first published at CTOvision.com .

Three Use Cases for Splunk Like it? 107 comments 0 Posted June 26, 2012 Keywords : Analytics The greatest source of potential use cases for technology is the user community. This is a great reason to attend events where customers are at the center of focus. This was what last month’s  Splunk Live DC  was like. Splunk is a very user-focused capability and when you create a venue where users can exchange info it can be a particularly virtuous event. The following are use cases from three Splunk customers. Splunk, as you probably know, derives knowledge and actionable information by indexing and searching machine data. Users at Splunk Live explained why they were so happy with the software by presenting three use cases. The users presenting there included Cisco, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Defense. These use cases all point to the  use of Splunk to handle their machine data effectively and efficiently. Here is more: Jeff Bollinger is an infosec investigator on the  Cisco Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), which provides enterprise-wide security monitoring and incident response. With Splunk, CSIRT can look  everywhere for anomalies by collecting all event data. Without Splunk, such a holistic approach would be overwhelming for a network as large as Cisco’s. Using Splunk, CSIRT was able to counter the OSX Flashback virus and separate IT operations issues from  security issues. Bollinger added that he was able to do all of this without being a programming expert, as Splunk is intuitive to use and its scripting language easy to navigate. By gathering all the machine data and indexing it with time stamps, Splunk could provide historical data to discover who was infected once signs of an attack are discovered. Splunk’s indexing also helps with monitoring, metrics, and threat reporting. The FDA got the most use out of Splunk through the Microsoft Exchange app, an example of the useful applications and add-ons that extend Splunk and make it easier to use. Microsoft Exchange handles mail, contacts, calendaring, and tasks, but the FDA did not have a way to monitor it to support security measures. With Splunk, the FDA could track inbound and outgoing messages, respond to requests in a timely manner, and enforce policy. Jake Groth, the VP of Security Engineering and Architecture at Defense Point Security , talked about using Splunk to deliver Big Data and enterprise logging as a service. It does so by supporting component and enterprise visibility, role based access controls, a good user experience, scalability, predictable capacity planning, and reliability. That Splunk supports to many different use cases also helps provide a range of offerings for different communities. For more on Splunk see our CTOlabs Write Up .

Exploring Technological Horizons with Recorded Future Like it? 138 comments 0 Posted July 27, 2012 Keywords : Analytics , forecasting , Predictive Analytics Technological innovation can be a huge advantage to early adopters or a massive disruption to organizations that do not see it coming. For the Department of Defense, disruptive technology is literally a matter of life and death, so they try to predict the high impact innovations of the future using a method called “Technological Horizon Scanning.” The premise behind the technique is that the greater the distance between two fields, the greater the impact would be if they were to come together. Think of historical examples such as internal combustion and transportation, electricity and illumination, or, more recently, distributed computing and gene sequencing . Traditionally, the Department of Defense had relied on statistical clustering to identify candidates then mathematically analyzing the different permutations of their combination.  This brute force technique would often take so long that once the data crunching and analysis was complete, the technology the Pentagon was exploring was no longer cutting edge. The Department of Defense turned to Recorded Future to make exploring technological horizons faster, more accurate, and verifiable, leading to a recent case study published on the Recorded Future blog . Recorded Future is a temporal analytics engine that pulls from over 150,000 sources daily and indexes results for analysis by event, entity, and time. It also includes events set to occur in the future and, by indexing those projections, harnesses the predictive power of the Web. Recorded Future also provides visualization tools to help detect trends. Recorded Future improved the Department of Defense’s Technological Horizon Scanning in several ways. The service was able to work with more data than analysts could handle on their own in multiple languages and from a variety of media,  allowing them to keep up with the fringes of a various technical and scientific disciplines. Recorded Future then added structure to that Big Data with temporal context. It did so without losing complexity, as analysts could dig into individual data points to find additional information and sources. This allowed them to separate outliers from legitimate hints at technological shift. Rather than having to create and consider possible technological permutations, Recorded Future allowed the Department of Defense  to compare and monitor real-world predictions to quickly narrow the scope of its verification. As a result, the Pentagon was able to shorten the process of creating data-driven technological predictions from months to weeks. Those predictions also became more accurate, as Recorded Future allowed them to track which predictions came true to perfect their methodology. Just as the Department of Defense uses Recorded Future to monitor and forecast protests and unrest , the temporal analytics engine has helped predict disruption in another field, technology. With Recorded Future, analysts can to anticipate, identify, and prepare for technological advancement that is till beyond the horizon, thereby helping the Department of Defense plan, research, and strategize about the future.

Big Money for Big Data Like it? 250 comments 0 Posted August 16, 2012 Keywords : Big Data Big Data is the data too large, complex, and fast-moving for conventional information infrastructure to handle. There’s been a lot of buzz about investment in cutting edge Big Data solutions and start ups, and for good reason. Venture capital for Big Data is sizable and growing. In 2010, Big Data start ups already received $1.53 billion in funding but in 2011 that amount jumped to $2.47 billion. And though investment declined overall last quarter, venture capital for IT remained steady . An example of the funding currently flowing into Big Data is the Data Collective, a fund recently covered in the New York Times Bits blog that specializes in disruptive and innovative solutions for leveraging overwhelming amounts of data from diverse sources in novel ways. The fund is currently small, with the first round raising about $6 million, but it already includes 35 equity partners with experience in the field. Investors in the initial fund included industry leaders such as Todd Papaioannou, the former chief cloud architect at Yahoo, and Abdur Chowdhury, the former chief scientist at Twitter. Inside sources also claim that a second fund of roughly $50 million is currently being raised. The federal government is also getting in on the action through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the CIA’s venture capital firm In-Q-Tel , and others. Some of the cutting edge firms funded by In-Q-Tel include Big Data leaders such as Cloudera , whose distribution is the most popular way to use the distributed computing framework Hadoop , and Recorded Future , which harnesses the predictive power of the Web by analyzing and indexing 150,000 online sources.   Login or register to post comments Feed: CTO Vision Alex Olesker Original article Connect: Authored by: Alex Olesker I am a research associate for Crucial Point LLC and a blogger with a Bachelor's of Science in Foreign Service from Georgetown University, I've worked or interned in technology, private intelligence, law enforcement, academia, and early childhood education, among other fields.
