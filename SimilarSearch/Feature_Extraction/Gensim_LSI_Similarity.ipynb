During the weekend event, almost 400 developers attended the conference.  Many stopped by the BigML stand to pick up a BigML t-shirt and most stuck around to find out how they can up their Machine Learning game while working in their favorite software development ecosystem. Mercè Martín Prats, our VP of Insights and Applications, gave a very popular Machine Learning crash course, which is further evidence of the subject’s meteoric rise in developer communities.  This is music to our ears as we have been on this bandwagon since our inception four years ago.  We truly believe that the days when Machine Learning will be an integral skill set for any developer worth their salt are not too far off.  After all, Machine Learning is another way to elegantly solve real-life problems by way of leveraging ever cheaper computing power. So, why exclude capable techies willing to learn and instead opt to limit its use to a select few academically minded researchers? It just does not make any sense. During her presentation, Mercè dove right into the Python code, demonstrating the steps to follow in using BigML’s REST API from within your  Python  environment that let’s you remotely manage BigML’s Machine Learning resources programmatically. Also among the topics she covered was  BigMLer , our command line tool built on our Python bindings.  With BigMLer you can automate even complex Machine Learning workflows with few lines of code. It is poetry in minimalism! We would like to thank the community for the great questions covering critical aspects such as service architecture, scalability and the model optimization controls in addition to all their  positive feedback  . We are looking forward to add to the Python cause in the future iterations of the event.  If you would like to contribute to BigML’s Python projects or if you missed the chance to grab a t-shirt at the event, just give us a holler on Twitter and we will projectile one your way in quick succession.

      "31723 (+ clojure big-ml) | The Official Blog of BigML.com Skip to content Follow: RSS Twitter The Official Blog of BigML.com Machine Learning Made Simple SIGNUP FREE BLOG DEVELOPERS GALLERY FEATURES HOW IT WORKS BigML Tags API , Clojure , Open Source (+ clojure big-ml) by ashenfad on January 17, 2013 We’re excited to announce a Clojure library for our machine learning API . We use Clojure everyday here at BigML, so we want to make it easy to fire up the REPL and dive right into building decision tree models and making predictions. The library is available from Clojars .  If you’re familiar with Leiningen , simply add this to your project’s dependencies to get started: [bigml/clj-bigml “0.1.0”] The library makes it easy to get, create, update, delete, and list BigML resources (which include  sources , datasets , models , predictions , and evaluations ).  The project readme has all the pertinent details, but we’ll highlight a couple Clojure specific features here. First, data can be shared with BigML in three ways.  A data source may be created using either a local file, a remote URL ( s3 and odata resources are supported), or directly from Clojure data: ;; source from local file (source/create \"some-local-directory/iris.csv.gz\") ;; source from remote URL (source/create \"https://static.bigml.com/csv/iris.csv\") ;; in-line source from Clojure data (source/create [[\"Make\" \"Model\" \"Year\" \"Weight\" \"MPG\"] [\"AMC\" \"Gremlin\" 1970 2648 21] [\"AMC\" \"Matador\" 1973 3672 14] [\"AMC\" \"Gremlin\" 1975 2914 20] [\"Honda\" \"Civic\" 1974 2489 24] [\"Honda\" \"Civic\" 1976 1795 33]]) Once you’ve built a model (see the readme for more on that), predictions may be generated with an API call. Alternatively, a model may be downloaded and converted directly into a Clojure function.  This approach means no waiting for an HTTP response.  It’s a great option when you need performance or just want to use your model offline. ;; get a previously created model from the famous iris dataset ;; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set (def iris-model (api/get iris-model-id)) ;; transform the model into a Clojure fn (def iris-local-predictor (prediction/predictor iris-model)) ;; apply the prediction fn to a list of field values (iris-local-predictor [7.6 3.0 6.6 2.1]) ;; --> \"Iris-virginica\" ;; or apply the prediction fn to a map of field-id to value (iris-local-predictor {\"000000\" 7.6 \"000001\" 3.0 \"000002\" 6.6 \"000003\" 2.1}) ;; --> \"Iris-virginica\" Please make sure to check out the short examples we’ve added here .  One example shows how to grow and use a random decision forest .  The other illustrates how to use sampling options to split a dataset into proper training and test sets. We hope this library will help Clojure developers explore BigML. Signing up is free and new accounts come with some initial credits.  Moreover, the API includes a development mode that waives the cost for small datasets. So we invite you to try out BigML and give us feedback!

PAPIs  (the International Conference on Predictive APIs and Apps) started in November 2014. It also organizes PAPIs Connect  event series that focuses on how Data, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are used by companies to create predictive apps that solve real problems in business and everyday life. For the first time in history, this edition of PAPIs Connect will perform a startup battle  in which the selection of contestants and winners will be chosen completely without human intervention thanks to our special and unique jury — an algorithm! This competition will be powered by the new technology  Telefonica Open Future and BigML are developing together  in order to rapidly discover the best startups actively working on state-of-the-art predictive apps.  The aim is to use a multitude of signals to pinpoint and support these innovators at a very early stage given a high confidence in their likelihood of success. In addition to the startup battle decision makers, CEO’s, CTO’s, developers, data scientists and technology leaders from around the world will come to Valencia to discuss real life cases, where they have used Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create value from data. Furthermore, the timing of the event gives participants more inspiration for creativity since it conveniently coincides with the world-famous Valencian  Fallas ! As we are wrapping up 2015, now is the time to Call for Proposals . PAPIs Connect is looking for creative speakers like you! Please submit your proposal before January 8, 2016, 11:59pm CET . Here are some topics we would love to hear about next March in Valencia: Deep Learning: demystifying enterprise use cases, business impact, how-tos for business leaders and developers AI / predictive technology for good causes AI for improved decision making Societal impact of AI Enterprise predictive apps as competitive weapons Introduction to APIs for decision makers Automatic Data Science / Machine Learning Benchmarks and comparisons between available technical tools and solutions (commercial as well as open source) Open Source: projects that make it easier to process data, to create and experiment with predictive models, or to operationalize those with predictive APIs. Do you think you might be a good candidate? Then, this is your opportunity to join in the proceedings  as it is a great chance to share your story with an audience of likeminded innovators and strategic management practitioners in turn receiving support and valuable community feedback. About PAPIs The  PAPIs conference series  has started in November 2014 in Barcelona, continued in Paris last May 2015, and Sydney in August 2015. So far more than 500 attendees from 25+ different countries have enjoyed discussions and presentations about predictive apps and their impact in business and real life. In 2016 PAPIs will take place in Boston, US, the dates and location of which will be announced shortly. Stay tuned to book your flight to Boston!
