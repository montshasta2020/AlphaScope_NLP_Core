2. The theory of ‘characteristic scores and scales’
In what follows, we briefly summarise the definition of the characteristic scores and scales according to Glänzel &
Schubert (1988a, 1988b). Consider a set of n papers published in a given subject field. The observed citations {Xi }ni=1
received by each paper in a given time period are then ranked in descending order X1∗ ≥ X2∗ ≥ · · · ≥ Xn∗ , where X1∗
denotes the citation rate of most frequently cited paper in the set and Xn∗ consequently the number of citations the least
cited paper has received.
